WORKSHOP SETUP & PREREQUISITES

During this workshop, you will be setting up an entire DevOps flow for a Java application. You will end with deploying to a Kubernetes cluster and then capitalizing on the benefits of adding a service mesh to the equation.

The following is a list of tools and software you will need to benefit the most from this workshop:

1. Your own GitHub account
2. Git
3. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or your tool of choice for building and publishing container images
4. [Helm 3](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or greater
5. An IDE of your choice. I always recommend [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
6. Maven. I'll be using Maven 3.6
7. Java, of course\! Version 8 or higher and any distro will do. I'll be using OpenJDK

A link to sign up for a free JFrog Platform account will be provided at the beginning of the workshop. You will also need admin access to a Kubernetes cluster, but don't let that deter you\! Options will be provided during the workshop if you do not have a cluster of your own to work with.
