We can’t wait to see you in a few days at our DevNexus Java 11 to 18 Hands-on Workshop!
As the title suggests, we’ll explore and use various features introduced between Java 11 and Java 18.

In terms of logistics, it’s simple. It’s a hands-on workshop, so we expect you to have a running laptop. That’s all! We will take care of installing the appropriate JDK version. And if you don’t want to mess with your existing setup, you will also have the ability to accomplish the exercises from the Oracle Cloud. Again, nothing to worry about, we’ll take care of the details.

See you at DevNexus and do not forget to bring your laptop... and your questions!
