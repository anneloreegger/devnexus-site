Hi there!

We‚Äôre so excited to have you join us for our ‚ÄúCreating a Kafka Streaming Data Pipeline‚Äù workshop at Devnexus! üöÄ

This workshop assumes little to no prior knowledge of Kafka, but we recommend you have some working knowledge of programming languages as we‚Äôll be using Python for the course. We‚Äôll build up a foundational understanding of Kafka and help you to build (and customize) your own end-to-end streaming data pipeline by the end of the workshop.

In order to make sure you‚Äôre fully prepared to get the most value out of our workshop, we have a few reminders for you. 

1. Please bring your own laptop to use during the workshop. 
* We have a preference for machines with a MacOS or Linux operating system installed; Linux on Windows can be accommodated. 
* If you do not have access to a personal machine, please let us know by Thursday, March 30 so that we can have a machine for you to use.

We‚Äôll be using Confluent Cloud throughout the workshop; please consider creating a free [Confluent Cloud](https://confluent.cloud/signup) account ahead of time.

3. Please have Python 3.6+ and [Apache Kafka](https://docs.confluent.io/kafka-clients/python/current/overview.html#ak-python) pre-installed on your machine. 
* Note that M1s require a manual install of librdkafka; [this blog post](https://dev.to/cerchie/installing-node-rdkafka-on-m1-for-use-with-sasl-3i47) contains instructions that will help. 

If you have any questions or need any assistance with the above prerequisites, please do not hesitate to reach out to one of us.

All the best!
