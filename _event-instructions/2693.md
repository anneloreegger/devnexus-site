Please have JDK 11 installed on your machine.

Either distribution is fine:
* [How to install  Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A)
* [How to install OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/install/)

You will be writing and compiling code.  If you prefer an IDE, please confirm
it is compatible with java 11.
