For this workshop you will need:
* GitHub account
* Java 17
* Favourite Java IDE
* Chrome or Firefox

Also, Hardware that can be used with WebAuthn protocol
* iPhone works very well
* Most android devices work too
* MacBooks with Thumbprint scanners work too (I have not tested with windows laptops but they probably work)

**Hardware keys such as Yubikey highly recommended [https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/)**
