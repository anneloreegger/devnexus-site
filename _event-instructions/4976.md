  * [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac) with [Kubernetes Setup](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#kubernetes)
  * [Linux Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube#installation)
6. Download latest [stable Istio release](https://github.com/istio/istio/releases) <em>not a Pre-release</em>: 

# Tutorial Source:

# Openshift requirements:
1. Sign up for a Red Hat [OpenShift Online](https://www.openshift.com/products/online/) account. There are two options: 
  * Starter free trial is perfect for individual experimentation, with limited resources.
  * The Pro plan includes more resources and has a monthly fee. 
2. OpenShift CLI: 
You need the OpenShift command-line tool oc to interact with your Kubernetes cluster. For installation instructions, refer to the official [OpenShift Online documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/).
