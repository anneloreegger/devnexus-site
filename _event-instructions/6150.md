title: Java on Kubernetes 101

---
In this hands-on workshop, we will learn the basics of Kubernetes. We will explore the command line kubectl, setup and configure a Java application, then deploy into a Kubernetes cluster. All of this will be done in an online environment with a integrated code editor and terminal, so you will not need to setup anything on your computer. We'll start with a brief introduction to microservices and Kubernetes, then dive into hands-on exercises to get you up to speed quickly.
