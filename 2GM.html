    <h2>Devnexus teams up with 2GM</h2>
    <p>For its 2019 conference, Devnexus has teamed up with the 2GM (Groovy, Grails, and Micronaut) communities, in furtherance of its mission, to promote and support open source values and technologies.</p>
    <p>We invite everyone in the 2GM communities to submit their proposals for workshops, presentations, and deep-dive sessions for the new 2GM Track. The deadline to submit proposals is rapidly approaching, so if you’ve got a Groovy, Grails, or Micronaut talk you’d like to present, the clock is ticking!</p>
