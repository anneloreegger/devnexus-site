title: Let's take a look at how a Jakarta EE cloud-native application should look!
description: Jakarta EE 10 has arrived and along with Eclipse MicroProfile, it has
  paved the way for Enterprise Java developers to develop easy-to-maintain, powerful
  applications that can be deployed on almost any environment. Jakarta EE applications
  can now be cloud-native applications and they should no longer be constrained by
  how they used to look 15~20 years ago. DevOps engineers will greatly benefit from
  this talk in which we’ll analyse the anatomy of a Jakarta EE application that’s
  geared to be cloud-native, and how these applications can benefit using standards
  to their benefit and longevity.
