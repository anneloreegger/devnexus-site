In this hands-on lab we will discuss when and how to develop pragmatic microservices using Java EE and WildFly Swarm. The lab takes a step-by-step approach using a simple but representative example starting from a vanilla Java EE monolithic application and ending in Dockerized WildFly Swarm microservices on the cloud with all the trimmings.
