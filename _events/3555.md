Kotlin is a practical language designed for the JVM. It focuses on pragmatism and safety, with an emphasis on interoperability and tool support. Kotlin is statically typed and includes null checks in the type system itself. The language runs anywhere Java does, from microservices to Android apps. This workshop will show how to use Kotlin to simplify anything you originally planned to do in Java.

Kotlin combines object-oriented programming with functional features like lambda expressions, functional types, and data classes. Since it comes from JetBrains, the company that produces the IntelliJ IDEA development environment, it's tool support is excellent. IntelliJ even provides a Java-to-Kotlin converter to help you get started.

This presentation will cover the basic types, defining and calling functions, programming with lambdas, higher order functions, and DSLs. The goal is to give you enough background to be productive while you continue to learn and grow with the language.
