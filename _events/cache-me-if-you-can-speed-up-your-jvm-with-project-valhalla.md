title: 'Cache Me If You Can: Speed Up Your JVM With Project Valhalla'
description: "OpenJDK’s Project Valhalla is set to revolutionize how the JVM handles
  data objects in memory. By bringing the characteristics of primitives to Java objects
  and classes you’ll see denser memory layouts that can lead to many advantages such
  as improved cache performance and a smaller memory footprint.\r\nThis talk offers
  an exploration of Valhalla's objectives, progress, and its potential impact on the
  Java ecosystem with examples throughout. Come discover how Project Valhalla is on
  the verge of reshaping the landscape of Java, paving the way for a more efficient
  and high-performing future."
