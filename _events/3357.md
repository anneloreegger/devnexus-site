Micronaut is a modern, JVM-based, full stack microservices framework designed for building modular, easily testable Micro Service applications in Java, Kotlin or Groovy. Micronaut is developed by the creators of Grails and takes inspiration from lessons learnt over the years building real-world applications from monoliths to microservices using Spring, Spring Boot and Grails.
