title: Batch Processing Cloud Apps with Java
description: In the world of cloud-native apps, we need to deal with a large amount
  of data from multiple sources. This requires considerable effort to read, process,
  and distribute. As the number of records increases, plain Java may not be the best
  solution. With many out-of-the-box solutions—such as transaction management, retry,
  chunk processing, and several templates—the lightweight framework of Spring Batch
  can help. Combined with the power of Kubernetes, you can easily make your batch
  processing rise to the clouds. We discuss this universe and its architecture and
  templates—providing live code examples to demonstrate all possibilities you have
  on your hands.
