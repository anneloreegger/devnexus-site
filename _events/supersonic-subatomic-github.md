title: Supersonic, Subatomic GitHub
description: "You've seen GitHub Actions, but did you know about GitHub Apps? \"GitHub
  Apps are tools that extend GitHub's functionality.\" A GitHub app lets you interact
  with GitHub -- or a third party system, or both! -- when certain things happen in
  a repository. Things like someone pushing to the repository, creating a pull request
  or issue, commenting on or editing pull requests, issues, etc. The official docs
  show you how to write an App using JavaScript, which is fine, but then you have
  to use JavaScript! \r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we'll look at how we can use our
  Java and Quarkus experience to write an application. We'll register the application
  with GitHub, set up the project for the application, and react to various events.
  At the end, we'll have a working GitHub application, written in Java (or Kotlin!)
  that is supersonic, subatomic awesomeness."
