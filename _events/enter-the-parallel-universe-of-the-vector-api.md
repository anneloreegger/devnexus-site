title: Enter The Parallel Universe of the Vector API
description: "Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) instructions have been available
  in Intel and other processor instruction sets for over 25 years.  The current implementation
  is Advanced Vector eXtensions (AVX), first introduced in the Sandy Bridge microarchitecture.\r\n\r\nUsing
  Vector processing through AVX can profoundly improve the performance level of an
  application that includes numerically intensive operations.  The difficulty is that,
  although the compiler should be responsible for determining their use, code is often
  too complex to do so effectively.\r\n\r\nIn JDK 16, an incubator module for the
  Vector API (not to be confused with the Vector collections class) was introduced.
  \ This allows a developer to express vector computations that reliably compile at
  runtime to optimal vector instructions.  The API has undergone several revisions
  resulting in the sixth incubator in JDK 21.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll explore
  how to use the Vector API in different use cases, comparing the code generated by
  the JIT compiler without the API and with it.  We'll also look at what difference
  this makes to the performance delivered."
