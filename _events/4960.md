The Kubernetes ecosystem can be very operator focussed and it can be a challenge for developers to distil the information that is relevant for their job. The Kubernetes hype train has reached full velocity and many organisations are now adopting the technology.  There are a large number of available tools aimed at solving a broad set of problems but it can be daunting choosing which to invest in. 
This session aims to provide developers with a thorough grounding on Kubernetes concepts, suggest best practices and get hands-on with some of the essential tooling.
