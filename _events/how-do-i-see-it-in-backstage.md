title: How do I see it in Backstage?
description: "Software Templates get lots of attention, and they’re a quick model
  for an introduction to Backstage. But daily development revolves around the Software
  Catalog. A central location for discovering everything isn’t very useful unless
  everything is there. How do you describe the elements of your environment in a way
  that Backstage understands?\r\n\r\nCome to this talk to learn about the basic Kinds
  of Backstage Entities and how Processors examine and validate them for addition
  to your Catalog. You’ll leave with a basic platform engineering vocabulary and an
  understanding of how Backstage models Components, APIs, Locations and other Entities
  in the catalog-info.yaml file."
