title: Mastering the Linux command line
description: "Short version: I'll show you everything you need to know about the Linux
  command line as a developer.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong(er) version:\r\n\r\nAs a developer,
  you often have to deal with Linux servers. Troubleshooting, digging through logs,
  editing configuration files, you name it. If you're used to working with Windows
  or OSX GUI's, the Linux terminal might appear fairly basic and difficult to use.\r\n\r\nBut,
  with some basic background knowledge and a small set of terminal commands in your
  toolbox, it can actually be extremely powerful and loads of fun!\r\n\r\nIn this
  session, I'll explain the concepts behind the Linux command line and I'll demo loads
  of useful stuff. You'll learn how to quickly navigate, find files, examine and search
  through logs, how to investigate a system under load, a bit of shell scripting,
  ssh tunneling and more!\r\n\r\nAt the end of this session, you'll have the chance
  to throw your own problems and use cases at me - I'll come up with solutions on
  the spot. Bring your own problems ;-)\r\n\r\nThis talk takes places entirely in
  the command line. No slides, no IDE, just a plain terminal window. After this session,
  you'll be on your way to master the Linux command line yourself!"
