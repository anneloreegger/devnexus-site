It's really about the economics of software development. Writing tests take time, but it saves time in the long run. Creating good tests is a skill. Tests can greatly influence the design of code we create. In this workshop we will see how writing tests is anything but a mechanical process. We will see both the regression benefits and the design benefits of creating tests. Learn by observing tests being created for a problem live. Then pair up with someone attending the workshop to test drive a program, from scratch, all the way to working code. Along the way measure the code coverage.
