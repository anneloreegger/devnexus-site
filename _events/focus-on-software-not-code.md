title: Focus on software, not code
description: "There is a recent trend to focus too much on code, sometimes losing
  sight of the end goal, which is running software, and it's costing everybody precious
  time and money.\r\nI will talk about the difference between code and software, and
  why it's so important to focus on the latter, without dismissing the former, using
  real-life examples and situations to illustrate the benefits of focusing on software
  and not just code, such as prioritizing optimizations, improving performance, fixing
  bugs, and even keeping tech debt under control.\r\n"
