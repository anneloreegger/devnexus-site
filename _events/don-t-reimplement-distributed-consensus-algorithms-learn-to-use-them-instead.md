title: Don’t Reimplement Distributed Consensus Algorithms! (Learn to Use Them Instead)
description: "Scaling your services is easy when your services are stateless. However,
  in real life applications have to deal with state - how do you scale stateful software
  systems and their data? This is where it may become scary - while modern storage
  solutions (from Etcd to Cassandra) promise to solve this problem for us, operating
  these solutions may be tricky. Even if you don’t have to reimplement underlying
  consensus algorithms (like Paxos and Raft), you still need to understand how they
  work to operate, debug, and scale your systems. \r\n\r\nThis talk explains the mechanics
  of different consensus algorithms in everyday terms. This talk is not an academic
  paper: instead of providing formal proofs and scientific language, it focuses on
  practical aspects of consensus algorithms’ usage. It explains actionable insights
  in (relatively) simple words without pitching a concrete approach or technology
  as a magic cure."
