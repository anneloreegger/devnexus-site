Kubernetes does an excellent job of recovering when there is an error. Although this is great from the perspective of Kubernetes, you probably still want to know when a problem occurred, how often did that happen, if it can happen again and what other consumers of your system were impacted.
 
Regardless if you are just beginning your journey with monitoring at application and Kubernetes level or you want to validate your point of view, join me in revealing practices around monitoring distributed applications through code examples combined with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger.

Where there’s Kubernetes and Java, there’s more than a way to solve a problem!
