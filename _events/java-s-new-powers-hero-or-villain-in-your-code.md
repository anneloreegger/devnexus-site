title: 'Java''s New Powers: Hero or Villain in Your Code?'
description: "With Java’s six-month release cadence, new features and enhancements
  appear like superheroes, more frequently than ever before, promising to address
  our pain points. These Java features are indeed powerful, but their impact depends
  on how they are used and integrated into our code. A poorly executed implementation
  can quickly turn a superhero into a villain, undermining the potential benefits.\r\n\r\nJoin
  me in this live hands-on coding session where I’ll demonstrate the capabilities
  of Java's latest features and the way they are or could be implemented in a real-world
  project. Prepare to witness the battle between Java's incredible features and the
  forces of poor implementation. I’ll talk about multiple use cases with practical
  strategies and best practices for using Java's latest enhancements, ensuring they
  shine as true superheroes in your development projects.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this
  session, you'll learn tips and tricks to utilize Java's new powers like Virtual
  Threads, String Templates, Pattern Matching, Records, Text Blocks and many more.
  Join me for an exploration of how Java can be your ally in the battle against code
  chaos."
