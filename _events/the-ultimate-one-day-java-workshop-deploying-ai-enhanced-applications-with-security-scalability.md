title: 'The Ultimate One-Day Java Workshop: Deploying AI-Enhanced Applications with
  Security & Scalability'
description: "The Ultimate One-Day Java Workshop: Deploying AI-Enhanced Applications
  with Security and High-Performance on Kubernetes and Serverless Platforms\r\n\r\nIntroduction:
  Welcome to a comprehensive workshop designed for those  eager to master the intricacies
  of deploying Java applications in cloud environments. As the software development
  landscape continues to evolve rapidly, the dual needs to  integrate Artificial Intelligence
  (AI) and deliver efficient, secure, and scalable deployment strategies become increasingly
  critical. This workshop aims to bridge the gap between traditional Java application
  deployment and modern cloud-based solutions, offering participants a deep dive into
  the latest technologies, methodologies, and best practices, including the exciting
  realm of AI.\r\n\r\nObjective: Our goal is to equip you with the knowledge and skills
  necessary to start navigating the complexities of Java deployment to cloud platforms
  in a safe, secure, and innovative way. Whether you're looking to deploy Java applications
  using traditional JAR files, explore the potential of containerization, venture
  into serverless architectures, or integrate AI to enhance application capabilities,
  this workshop will provide you with a solid foundation and practical insights to
  enhance your deployment strategies. Special emphasis will be placed on not only
  mastering deployment techniques but also on how to incorporate AI into your Java
  applications and deliver these advanced solutions in a safe manner.\r\n\r\nEnvironment:
  \  All code and development will take place online using Google’s platform\r\n\r\nPreReqs:
  \r\nAttendees should have some familiarity with the Java programming language. \r\nAttendees
  should bring a laptop with wifi capabilities.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAgenda \r\n\r\nPart 1:
  Introduction and Overview\r\n Setting the stage for an in-depth exploration of Java
  deployment in cloud environments. We'll provide an overview of the workshop's structure,
  aiming to equip attendees with a solid understanding of the deployment lifecycle,
  from packaging to deployment, with a focus on Java applications. The facilitators
  will introduce themselves, offering insights into their expertise and what attendees
  can expect to learn, particularly about secure deployment options like JAR, CRaC,
  native compilation, and containerization.\r\n\r\nPart 2: Java Packaging and Deployment
  Options\r\nThis segment delves into the technicalities of Java packaging and deployment,
  offering a comparative analysis of deployment strategies such as JAR deployment,
  Checkpoint/Restore in Application Continuity (CRaC), and native compilation. We'll
  explore containerization including using application frameworks for MicroProfile.
  With hands-on practical demonstrations using Google Cloud, the attendees will be
  able to use Google’s online development environments to explore the various deployment
  workflows from JAR to cloud, JAR to container to cloud, and native compilation to
  serverless architectures. \r\n\r\nPart 3: Ensuring Security in Java Deployment\r\nThis
  critical section addresses the paramount importance of a secure software supply
  chain in Java deployment. We begin with an introduction to essential tools like
  Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) and dependency scanning, moving on to a detailed
  discussion on mitigating cyber threats and adopting secure software development
  practices.  We’ll look at commercial options (with a demonstration of Sonatype Nexus
  and Lifecycle) review relevant open source tools and discuss the various pros-and-cons
  of each.\r\n\r\nLunch\r\n\r\nPart 4:  Extended Architectural Decisions\r\nPost-lunch,
  the conversation shifts to architectural decisions, contrasting Kubernetes with
  serverless architectures in terms of cost, scalability, operational management,
  and security. This part aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of choosing
  the right architecture for Java applications in the cloud.\r\n\r\nPart 5: AI in
  Development and Deployment \r\nThe final part of our workshop explores the revolutionary
  role of AI in development and deployment processes. With examples using  HuggingFace,
  PaLM and GEMINI the attendees will use LangChain4J in a hands-on session to integrate
  Google’s AI APIs  into Java applications. We'll also examine the security implications
  of AI, including supply chain concerns and legislative impacts, followed by a series
  of short discussions on the elements of building secure and efficient deployment
  pipelines. \r\n\r\nClosing\r\nThe workshop concludes with a recap of key learnings,
  emphasizing the importance of automation, security in the supply chain, and the
  variety of deployment options available. An open Q&A session offers participants
  the opportunity to clarify doubts and engage directly with the experts.\r\n\r\n"
