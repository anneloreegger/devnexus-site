title: What is Looming in Java
description: "In the evolving landscape of software development, Java continues to
  be a stalwart choice for building reliable, scalable, and performant applications.
  The language and its ecosystem have evolved, incorporating modern paradigms and
  tools that cater specifically to the needs of high-scale applications. In JDK 21,
  java released Virtual Thread, which is known as Project Loom.\r\n\r\nProject Loom
  introduces lightweight and efficient virtual threads called fibers, massively increasing
  resource efficiency while preserving the same simple thread abstraction for developers.
  In this talk we will introduce how Fibers can reduce the effort of developing and
  managing high throughput applications.  We’ll take a quick peak at asynchronous
  coding styles, and then look at how Loom fits in today’s Java applications."
