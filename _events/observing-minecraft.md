title: Observing Minecraft
description: "This talk will cover adding observability to your Java Minecraft Server.
  We’ll go through exporting important metrics and logs from the server to track things
  like player uptime and efficiency of potential mods. We’ll look into monitoring
  server health and alerting on issues in real time.\r\nParticipants should expect
  to leave knowing some observability basics and how to use the monitoring to understand
  system health and avoid some potential incidents."
