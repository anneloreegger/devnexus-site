title: Head-first Reactive with Spring and Reactor
abstract: "Spring Boot 2 and Spring Framework 5 have arrived and they deliver on a
  key promise: Supporting Reactive programming using Reactor 3.1 to model non-blocking
  flows. \r\n\r\nMore than learning about a new framework, the developer is challenged
  with a new mindset. In this Workshop, we aim to deliver the survival kit to understand
  reactive programming trade-off, when to choose it and read/write Reactor flows.
  In the context of Spring Boot 2, we'll be exploring some of the ecosystem support
  like web, data and security."
