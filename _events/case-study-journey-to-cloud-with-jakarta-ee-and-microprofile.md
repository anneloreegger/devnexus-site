title: 'Case Study: Journey to Cloud with Jakarta EE and MicroProfile'
description: 'The journey to cloud is an ongoing challenge for many enterprises. Some
  organizations have tackled this endeavor easily, while others have delayed the process,
  waiting for the right time or technology to get started. In this session, we will
  describe the migration of a production application from a solo monolith to an application
  system augmented with MicroProfile microservices. In this case, the application
  team opted maximize the value of their investment: maintain the original application
  and enhance it with services that surround it. We will include technical challenges
  and how we overcame them using Helidon, an open-source framework that makes it easy
  to write Java microservices, including MicroProfile microservices that easily integrate
  with Jakarta EE applications.'
