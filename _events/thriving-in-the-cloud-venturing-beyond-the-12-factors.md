title: 'Thriving in the cloud: Venturing beyond the 12 factors'
description: Enabling applications to really thrive (and not just survive) in cloud
  environments can be challenging. The original 12 factor app methodology helped to
  lay out some of the key characteristics needed for cloud-native applications...
  but... as our cloud infrastructure and tooling has progressed, so too have these
  factors. In this workshop we'll dive into the extended and updated 15 factors needed
  to build cloud native applications that are able to thrive in this environment,
  and get hands-on with open source technologies and tools (including MicroProfile,
  Jakarta EE, Open Liberty, OpenJ9, and more!) that can help us achieve this.
