As a Java developer, you may have a need to access native libraries, such as Tensorflow, SqlLite, ffmpeg, OpenGL, but later find that JNI is your default choice. JNI (Java Native Interface) requires native code to be installed. You’ll quickly find that JNI wrapper code is difficult to maintain.
New to OpenJDK 17 is the Foreign Linker API (JEP 412) as a replacement or alternative for JNI to provide a pure-Java solution and perform comparable to, or better than, JNI.
The aim of this talk is to help you be proficient at creating Java programs capable of accessing devices and/or native libraries mainly focussing on OpenJDK 17’s Foreign Linker API.
