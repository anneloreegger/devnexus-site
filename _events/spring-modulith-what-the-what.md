title: 'Spring Modulith:  What the what?'
description: "When designing software systems, architects and developers have plenty
  of architectural options from which to choose.  Over the last few years, we have
  seen the growth of Microservice-based systems. However, the idea of monolithic,
  modular systems has recently regained popularity.  Regardless of which architecture
  we choose, how can we build the individual applications that comprise our overall
  system such that their structure is evolvable to follow business requirements?\r\nWhat
  if I were to tell you there was a way for you to express these logical application
  modules in code so that you can build well-structured, domain-aligned Spring Boot
  applications?  Spring Modulith does this by providing the developer a way to declare
  logical modules in Spring Boot applications.  It also provides the tooling needed
  to write Junit tests that run structural validation tests, run integration tests
  for individual modules, and to document the module arrangement.  It also has features
  that let you implement module interactions in a loosely coupled way and then lets
  you observe module interactions between each other at runtime.  In this talk, we
  discuss the features that are available and then in a live coding demonstration
  show you how they work."
