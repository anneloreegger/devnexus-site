title: 'LLMs and Spring: Building Smart Chat Applications with Redis'
description: Generative AI and the emergence of LLMs are radically changing content
  retrieval and generation industries. Using a combination of Natural Language Processing
  (NLP) techniques, foundation Machine Learning models (GPT and friends), and vector
  databases, chat-driven smart applications are changing the landscape of modern apps.
  This presentation explores the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, which
  leverages semantic search to dynamically infuse factual knowledge into a large language
  model (LLM) prompt. This technique enables contextual augmentation of the LLM, enhancing
  its performance in various tasks such as answering questions, summarizing content,
  or generating new content. Redis, a vector database and full-text search engine,
  enables RAG workflows. In this session, we'll explore building RAG applications
  using Redis and Spring Boot.
