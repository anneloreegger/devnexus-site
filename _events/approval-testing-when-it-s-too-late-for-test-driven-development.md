title: 'Approval Testing: When it''s too late for Test-Driven Development'
description: "Approval Testing may seem odd compared to Test-Driven Development, but
  it’s designed to let you write automated tests when you already have a large codebase
  (that may already be in production) and/or the business requirements are out of
  date, incomplete, or completely missing. While this may sound crazy, it’s something
  most programmers have had to deal with.\r\n\r\nThe Good News is that Approval Testing
  evolved as a solution for just this kind of problem. It makes the reasonable assumption
  that the current behavior of production code is correct, and compares it with how
  the system behaves after you’ve made some changes. If the results are identical
  then the test passes; if not, then it shows you the differences so you can decide
  whether the changes are correct or not. With Approval Tests in place, you can safely
  refactor the existing production code, then start introducing Test-Driven Development
  when adding new features to the system."
