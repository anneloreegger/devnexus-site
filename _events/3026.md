Just as automotive manufacturers conduct crash tests to detect points of failure in automobiles, chaos engineering can help you explore your systems to find weaknesses before they become a problem. By identifying points of failure proactively you can avoid many of the headaches that come with reacting to an event. Discover chaos engineering through real-world use cases at companies like Netflix and Chick-fil-A.
