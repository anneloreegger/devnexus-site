title: Building RESTful Web Services with Jakarta EE
description: In this workshop you will examine and work with the Jakarta EE 10 implementation
  of Jakarta REST 3.1. You will work through several modules that will provide you
  with experience in developing RESTful services. Not only will you be looking at
  the traditional hosting of REST services on an application server, but you will
  also learn how to embed a specialized REST server in most any type of Java application.
  It does not end there as this workshop will show you how to implement REST clients
  using JSON-B to go from an object to JSON and then back again. Come prepared to
  discuss what you will want to do with REST and then workshop your needs.
