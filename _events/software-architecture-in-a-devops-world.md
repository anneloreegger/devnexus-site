title: Software architecture in a DevOps world
description: "Most modern software teams strive for Continuous Delivery of business
  impact with a DevOps mindset: you build it, you run it. With short iterations and
  continuous feedback loops, teams deploy new software to production daily.\r\nBut
  how about the role of a software architect in such a fast-paced world? With daily
  deployments, is there even time for software architecture? As an architect, how
  do you prevent being a delaying factor to the pace and success of a team? And how
  do you keep up?\r\n\r\nIn this session, I'll share my experiences as a software
  architect in the DevOps world. I'll talk about \"just enough\" architecture and
  moving from up front design to evolving architecture.\r\nAfter this session, you'll
  have practical insights and tips in how to work as an architect with a DevOps team."
