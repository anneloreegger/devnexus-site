title: Conway’s Law and Digital Transformation
description: Conway’s Law posits that the design of a system mirrors the communication
  structure of the organization that created it. As businesses increasingly adopt
  modern technologies to enhance operations and deliver value, the alignment between
  organizational structures and system architectures becomes critical. Let's explore
  the implications of Conway’s Law in the context of digital transformation, examining
  how traditional, hierarchical structures often hinder the agility and innovation
  required for modern, scalable systems.
