Android O was announced this past spring at Google IO 2017. Drop in to hear a rundown of all the new and exciting features that you as a developer can take advantage of in the new O release. From the new AutoFill of forms to PiP, Picture in Picture, to API change goodness. Of course more updates around Notifications! Can we say OpenJDK? That alone is huge! You will also get the latest on Android IDE and build tools.
