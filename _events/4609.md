Java was doomed to become a legacy platform in this new cloud-native, serverless world. Slow startups, and high memory consumption made Java simply an alien in this new brave new world. But then Quarkus was created: the Supersonic, Subatomic Java platform. With Quarkus we're able to just save a file and automatically refresh and check the changes in our code in a matter of milliseconds. And thanks to a perfect match with GraalVM, we can use Quarkus to compile our projects to a native image, granting us millisecond startup time and a few MB of memory consumption. Be welcomed: with Quarkus you can still use your Java skills in the next age of software development.
