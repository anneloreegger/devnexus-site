title: Cooking Recipes, Coding, an IDE and YOU
description: "Tasks from our everyday lives, such as cooking, involve initiating and
  accomplishing multiple sub-tasks. Over time, we usually master or improve upon these
  processes with practice. Let’s apply these two concepts;  a cooking recipe and hands-on
  coding experience, to learn more about Java’s Future and CompletableFuture API,
  important \"utensils\" to cater to asynchronous or non-blocking needs in Java.\r\n\r\nIn
  this session, we’ll walk through centuries old Indian recipe ‘Paneer Tikka Masala’-
  a dish cherished by folk across the globe. In the talk, we’ll draw a parallel between
  the challenges of our recipe’s parts which involve asynchronicity and non-blocking
  activities, and how Java's APIs can address them in similar situations in your application
  code.\r\n\r\nLearning these concepts using Coding Katas, together we will fix failing
  code, hands-on, and learn how to work with Java’s CompletableFuture. By following
  a trail of TODOs and HINTs in the code, and an accompanying README, all integrated
  in the same project, you’ll experience the code, rather than just watching a deck,
  in an Integrated Development Environment!\r\n\r\nIf you are a library or an API
  author, this talk may inspire you to create Code Katas to help others understand
  and correctly use your libraries/API.\r\n\r\nWith this session you’ll learn how
  to make Paneer Tikka Masala and while learning new or better ways to use Java asynchronous
  and non-blocking APIs."
