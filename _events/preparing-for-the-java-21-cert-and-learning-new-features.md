title: Preparing for the Java 21 cert and learning new features
description: Looking to learn about features in the language added after Java 17 in
  more detail? As programmers we are used to dealing with edge cases. But what about
  edge cases in the language? As certification book authors, we encounter lots of
  interesting and/or surprising behavior.  After a brief overview of the cert, we

  session and walk away with an increased awareness in these Java topics.
