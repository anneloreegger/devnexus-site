“Java through the ages” - History of Java of course
 “Deprecated” - rarely used features
“Billys cup of Joe”  - clues about real Java tech from our very own Billy Korando
And many many more.
Come be a part of this awesome event and witness the encyclopaedic knowledge (or lack ) of your favourite Java celebs as the try to answer clues like
“In Java 15 we said goodbye to this German rhinoceros”
“the name for the Java codebase prior to Hotspot”
