title: 'Spring Recipes: A Collection of Common-Sense Solutions'
description: Over the years, Spring has evolved to solve the ever-increasing demands
  placed on software teams. From circuit breakers to security to queues to Kubernetes,
  Spring has an answer to that! But breadth can be overwhelming especially when you
  need to deploy to production yesterday. While knowing maybe half the battle, left
  unsaid is applying that knowledge to real-world situations; in other words, how
  do you bridge the gap between knowing Spring can do that to actually using Spring
  to fix your issue? With a plethora of examples, this talk will walk you through
  common problems in modern software development. From monitoring to testing to messaging
  to reactive programming, this talk will give you concrete solutions for your day-to-day
  needs.
