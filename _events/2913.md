RSocket is an open-source network protocol developed in collaboration with Netflix, Facebook, Pivotal and others that was designed to handle the challenges of communication in the cloud. In this session, Ryland will discuss how RSocket is being used to simplify the way enterprises build and operate cloud-native applications, dramatically reducing operational overhead and speeding development by allowing developers to focus on their product instead of their network infrastructure.
