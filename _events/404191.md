title: Revisiting Design Patterns after 20
description: "In 1994, the Gang of Four brought to us 23 different design patterns
  that helped thousands, maybe millions of developers, to design better code and share
  a common language. Almost three decades later, improvements in the Java language
  allow us to revisit most of these design patterns and propose novel ways to solve
  the same problems.\r\n\r\nJoin us at this talk when we perform some live refactorings
  of code using legacy implementations of design patterns into new code using the
  latest improvements of Java 20. Come and witness how Strategy, Template Method,
  Visitor, Command, Decorator, Builder, and other patterns can significantly benefit
  from modern features of Java, such as lambdas, records, switch expressions, and
  much more."
