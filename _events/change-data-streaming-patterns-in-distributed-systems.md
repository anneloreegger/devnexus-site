title: Change Data Streaming Patterns in Distributed Systems
description: "Microservices are one of the big trends in software engineering of the
  last few years; organizing business functionality in several self-contained, loosely
  coupled services that help teams work efficiently, and make the most suitable technical
  decisions.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will discuss and showcase how open-source
  change data capture (CDC) using Debezium can help with the challenges developers
  often face when working with microservices.  The session will not only cover what
  is CDC and how Debezium works, but it will include three critical patterns, Outbox,
  Stranger Fig, and Saga. We will discuss these patterns in-depth and discover how
  they overcome the challenges when working with microservices."
