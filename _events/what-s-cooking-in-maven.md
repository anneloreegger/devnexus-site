title: What's Cooking in Maven?
description: "It’s been over 10 years since Maven 3 saw the light, bringing initial
  multi-module support. Later releases brought a lot of improvements, bug fixes, and
  of course coloured output.\r\n\r\nBut the Maven community hasn’t been resting on
  their laurels. A lot of effort has gone into the future of Maven. You may have heard
  about Maven 4, Maven Wrapper, or Maven Daemon. Why should you care? And how will
  it change the way you use Maven? I will show you by using the latest snapshot builds
  of Maven - time will tell if that’s a brave or a stupid idea…\r\n\r\nJoin me to
  find out what the future of Maven has for you!"
