One of the most intriguing classes in the JDK is the Collectors utility class, with a collection of some highly powerful functions that are useful during the reduce operation of streams. The functions that are in this class have so much to offer and yet, due to their complex nature, often are not used as much as they should be. Using well defined live coded examples, we will take up several common programming problems. Discuss them quickly and drive the implementation of these using the Collectors' methods. By the end of this presentation you will know more throughly the power of Collectors and how to apply the methods in there.
