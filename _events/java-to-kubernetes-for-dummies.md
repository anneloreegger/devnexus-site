title: Java to Kubernetes for dummies
description: "Kubernetes, it looks really great. Think about the great features: scaling,
  reproducibility, etc. Everyone is talking about it, it's hype! So, Let's migrate
  our Java apps to the cloud and Kubernetes!\r\n\r\nWait a minute ... Have you seen
  all these YAML files? We hate YAML! It is already a full time job to maintain our
  Java applications but now with Kubernetes, we also have to\r\n\r\n- write and maintain
  Dockerfile files\r\n- write and maintain YAML files\r\n- configure and rething our
  existing CI/CD and deployment architecture\r\n- etc.\r\n\r\nYes during this talk,
  we are going to suffer \U0001F47F ... but I promise, I will guide you, teaching
  you the basics of Kubenetes to move your Java apps. I will also show you a way to
  move your Java apps to Kubernetes with only 6 lines of XML \U0001F923"
