Kubernetes is great, but sometimes can be hard too. What about making it easy and productive at the same time? And what if we would spark joy while coding Kubernetes-Native Java applications?

Look no further! Join us on this talk and learn how to have loads of fun with millisecond application restarts, experience tons of productivity with tools such as continuous testing and dev services, and how to make the job of packaging, sharing, deploying, and updating your code on Kubernetes a matter of a few keystrokes. Did we mention live demos? Yes, we do have them!
