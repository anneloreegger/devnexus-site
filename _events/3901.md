In this session, learn how Project Reactor enables you to create scalable reactive apps, how streaming platforms help, & how Spring Cloud Stream leverages both to provide fully reactive pipelines for system-wide (ridiculous!) scalability.

_The presenter will code all examples live & in real-time_.
