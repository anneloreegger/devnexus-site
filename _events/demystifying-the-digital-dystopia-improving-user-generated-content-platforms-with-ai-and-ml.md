title: 'Demystifying the Digital Dystopia: Improving User Generated Content Platforms
  with AI and ML'
description: "In the past year, GPT-4 opened the world’s eyes to the power of Artificial
  Intelligence. This awakening has brought concerns of neural networks that blur the
  lines of reality and sentient systems that will take over the internet and push
  their own evil agenda on the masses. In reality, these developments in AI technology
  have the power to be used to make the internet a better place by helping with mundane
  tasks like content detection and moderation. \r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll look
  at various approaches to content detection and moderation of live streaming platforms,
  and how to improve them with the help of AI. We’ll see how to analyze live streams
  for offensive or inappropriate content and use that analysis as a prompt for moderator
  intervention. We’ll also see how we can use AI content detection to assist in stream
  discovery, monetization and how to analyze chat messages for sentiment analysis
  and PII detection. "
