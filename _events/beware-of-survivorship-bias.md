title: Beware of Survivorship Bias!
description: "Most talks on a typical conference schedule contain success stories
  of technology. This could lead to survivorship bias. Survivorship bias causes you
  to draw false conclusions because you mostly heard about successes, but hardly ever
  about failures. Yet failures provide us with lots of valuable knowledge: when not
  to apply a certain technique, pattern or process.\r\n\r\nSo no success stories in
  this talk! Just some 'silver bullets' we tried to use to solve our problems, but
  turned out to be Very Bad Ideas™. We’ll share how survivorship bias can easily influence
  your ideas and cloud your judgement.\r\n\r\nAfter attending this talk you'll be
  more aware of survivorship bias and what you can do to keep your head cool, no matter
  how many 'silver bullets' are fired at you. "
