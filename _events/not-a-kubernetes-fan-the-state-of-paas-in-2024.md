title: Not a Kubernetes fan? The state of PaaS in 2024
description: "Kubernetes won the containers orchestration war. But has it made deploying
  your apps easier?\r\nLet's explore some of Kubernetes extensive app developer tooling,
  but mainly what the PaaS space looks like in 2024; 17 years after Heroku made it
  popular.\r\nIs Heroku still around? What about Cloud Foundry? \r\nAnd what are those
  new comers (fly.io, repl.it) worth?\r\nDid the Cloud giants replace them all?"
