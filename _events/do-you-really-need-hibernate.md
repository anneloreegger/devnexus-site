title: Do you really need Hibernate?
description: "Projects often use Java Persistence API (JPA) by default and, thus,
  mostly Hibernate. But do all applications need a comprehensive object/relational
  mapping (ORM) with all conceivable functions?\r\n\r\nThis talk examines the architecture
  of database-centric applications and discusses whether you always need an object
  graph for persistence.\r\n\r\nUsing an example application, it is shown how pure
  SQL, with the help of jOOQ and (nested) Java Records simplifies data access and
  how common ORM problems, such as the n+1 select problem, can be avoided.\r\nFinally,
  the possibility of combining jOOQ and JPA/Hibernate and thus using the best of both
  worlds is discussed."
