title: Quarkus for Spring Developers
description: "In this session, I will show concepts and conventions familiar to Spring
  developers and how those same concepts and conventions can be implemented in Quarkus,
  all while highlighting similarities and differences between them. Additionally,
  I will show similarities and differences in how testing is done, highlighting Quarkus
  Dev Services.\r\n\r\nThis session will be mostly live coding while minimizing the
  amount of slides. I will introduce an existing Spring application with a full test
  suite and build a Quarkus equivalent version of it, live."
