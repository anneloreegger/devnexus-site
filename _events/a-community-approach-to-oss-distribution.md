title: A Community Approach to OSS Distribution
description: "There are a variety of different attacks on the open source supply chain,
  including exploitation of zero day vulnerabilities, injection of malicious code
  or back-doors, and typo-squatting of popular libraries. And the systems that we
  rely upon for the distribution of OSS were not designed with a security mindset
  to prevent these sorts of attacks. There has to be a better way for open source
  authors and maintainers to securely deliver their packages to end users!\r\n\r\nEnter
  Pyrsia, a new software distribution system that is decentralized, community-driven,
  foundation governed, and built with a security first focus. In this presentation
  we will talk about how Pyrsia is designed, how you can use it to distribute and
  consume software packages, and how you can get involved in the Pyrsia community
  to grow the library of OSS software available freely and securely for all."
