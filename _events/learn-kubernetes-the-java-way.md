title: Learn Kubernetes the Java way
description: "Are you a Java developer making the first steps with cloud based technologies?
  Is learning Kubernetes the hard way a bit too... hard? \r\nWorry not! In this session,
  we'll go over the fundamentals of k8s to make your journey into using it simpler
  and more enjoyable. \r\n\r\nIn a true Java fashion we'll start with a Factory...
  kidding! with a test-driven exploration of what k8s is, its concepts and capabilities
  and learn why it's such a powerful tool.\r\n\r\nWe'll write tests that spin real
  k8s clusters with Testcontainers, explore what happens inside, break the assumptions,
  and truly get that first hands-on experience that'll make you both confident and
  a bit dangerous at working with this 10-letter staple of the clouds.\r\n\r\nPS.
  there will be yaml, but as little as possible, pinky promise!"
