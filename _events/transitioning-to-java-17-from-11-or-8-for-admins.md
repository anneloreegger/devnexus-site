title: Transitioning to Java 17 from 11 or 8 for Admins
description: "If you're responsible for deploying Java-based apps (as an admin or
  developer), you know that transitioning to a new major Java version can be painful--or
  you may at least fear it will be, so perhaps you/your org have dragged your feet.
  But new versions can also bring important benefits. \r\n\r\nWhile you can readily
  find resources discussing Java LANGUAGE and architecture changes between the LTS
  (and non-LTS) versions, sometimes it's hard for an admin or maintenance dev to sort
  through what matters for them (who won't be \"touching\" code): which JVM changes
  are inherent vs optional, which may break or impact how code/apps perform, which
  may improve things, and so on. This session will look at key changes of this sort
  for those moving to Java 17, whether from Java 11 or 8."
