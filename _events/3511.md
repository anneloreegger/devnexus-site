Micronaut has been designed specifically for building Microservice style applications and provides many capabilities related to deploying those applications to cloud providers such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Cloud Foundry.  These environments offer many powerful and important capabilities like service discovery, distributed configuration sharing, dynamic load balancing and more.  Micronaut provides support for taking advantage of these rich services with minimal burden on application developers.  Micronaut does all of the heavy lifting leaving the application code clean, simple, and largely portable across cloud providers.  This session will explore and demonstrate many of the capabilities provided by Micronaut that relate to taking advantage of these cloud provider services with the aim to make it very easy for developers to get started building and deploying Micronaut applications to the cloud provider of their choosing.
