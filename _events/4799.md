In this session we will discuss the best practices for Java code and compiler configurations to maximize performance with GraalVM and how to measure performance in a reliable manner. We will talk about how to achieve minimal memory footprint and binary size of GraalVM native images — programs compiled ahead of time to native executables. A comparison of profile-guided optimizations for ahead-of-time compilation and just-in-time compilation will show the benefits and drawbacks of the two approaches. 
After this session you will have a better idea how to use GraalVM for the maximum potential to run your applications faster!
