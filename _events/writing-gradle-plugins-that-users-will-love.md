title: Writing Gradle plugins that users will love
description: "One of the great things about Gradle Build Tool is that plugins are
  easy to write and there is a thriving ecosystem of freely available community plugins.
  \ It's easy to find one or more plugins that implement desired functionality, however,
  it's hugely disappointing when a plugin provides an awesome capability, but wreaks
  havoc on the performance of the build, creates undesirable side effects, or doesn't
  work with a certain version of Gradle.  If only every Gradle plugin was written
  and tested well.\r\n\r\nThis talk is intended for Gradle plugin authors who want
  to learn how to write plugins that consumers will love to use.  We'll explore the
  following concerns by looking at an example plugin and discussing ways to improve
  it:\r\n\r\n- Plugin architecture\r\n- Task configuration avoidance\r\n- Configuration
  cache compatibility\r\n- Planning for and testing with the build cache\r\n- Backwards
  compatibility testing \r\n \r\nYou'll learn strategies for not only writing your
  plugin well, but keeping it healthy and well behaved as it evolves and new versions
  of Gradle are released."
