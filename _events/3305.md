Most of the industry is working on modernizing existing applications. The end goal may be to develop microservices in the cloud, but usually the first step is to containerize the applications and run them in Kubernetes. This step brings its own challenges which need to be addressed otherwise your data may become inconsistent. This talk will discuss the issues running containerized mission critical applications in Kubernetes and how to resolve them. It will cover how to configure and test these applications so that data remains consistent by making sure the transactions can be recovered.
