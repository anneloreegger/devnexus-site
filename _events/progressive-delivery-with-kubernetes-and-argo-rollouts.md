title: Progressive Delivery with Kubernetes and Argo Rollouts
description: "Progressive Delivery is the process of releasing service updates in
  a controlled and gradual manner hence reducing risk. There are multiple ways to
  achieve this if you are using Kubernetes. Join me in this session to explore different
  deployment strategies like rolling updates, blue/green and canary releases. \r\nFinally,
  we'll see canary releases in action using Argo Rollouts to automate  promotion and
  rollback of updates based on metric analyses."
