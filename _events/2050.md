This presentation will cover ElasticSearch general concepts, and the configuration and deployment of this fault-tolerant indexing and search system. The presentation will focus on real-world use-cases and optimization techniques in running high-performing ElasticSearch cluster on AWS. Some of the topics covered will focus on general cluster configuration, organizing data, retrieving data efficiently, avoiding failure and performance degradation in a running cluster. Real-world use cases will detail how Elasticsearch is typically leveraged along with Apache Spark in distributed environments to process large amounts of heterogeneous data.
