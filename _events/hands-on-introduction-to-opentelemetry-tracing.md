title: Hands-on introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing
description: "Tracking a request’s flow across different components in distributed
  systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen
  to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already:
  Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind.\r\n\r\nObservability is built on three
  pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring
  an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now
  OpenTelemetry compatible.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll describe the above in more detail
  and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry
  in your distributed architecture."
