title: Don’t Expect Developers to be Security Experts!
description: "Developers are not security experts! Why not? And should they be?\r\n\r\nWe’re
  still learning — sometimes through trial and error — the best way to tackle security
  issues that won’t negatively interfere with delivering functional (and secure) software.\r\n\r\nOne
  thing is sure, there is only a subset of prevention and mitigation strategies that
  make sense to put on a developer’s plate. Even then, assuming all devs are equipped
  to handle this additional workload is unreasonable.\r\n\r\nMelissa will define common
  security related terms and lingo; share typical places to shore up applications
  when it comes to dependencies, packaging, and supply chain concerns; and discuss
  the plethora of scanning tools available today and how they actually work. Learn
  how to integrate a measure of security that makes sense in existing development
  processes and how to introduce a security culture to your team in a healthy way
  without exhausting your developers."
