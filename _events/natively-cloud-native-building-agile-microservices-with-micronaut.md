title: Natively Cloud Native - Building Agile Microservices with Micronaut
description: This talk is a fast-paced introduction to the Micronaut framework, from
  creating the first app to orchestrating a microservice federation and deploying
  to the cloud. We will cover the basics of writing Micronaut apps, communication
  between services, building for resiliency, managing configuration, and deploying
  to a cloud provider. By the time we’re finished, you’ll have a good understanding
  of both the distinctives and features of the framework and be ready to start building
  and deploying your own apps with Micronaut. Buckle up!
