This talk surveys many of the features of Kotlin through use cases that drive their adoption. The goal is not just to see what Kotlin can do, but to understand when and why to use it.

Topics covered will include sorting and searching, windowed collections, when to use scope functions like apply, let, and also, how to use Kotlin to access RESTful web services and process the results, how to implement delegates, and more.
