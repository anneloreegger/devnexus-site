title: Demystifying The Dreaded A/B Test
description: 'The A/B test! We''ve all thought it: "What''s the point? How much configuration
  do we need?" If you''re familiar with the scientific method, those steps carve out
  the path to experimentation and A/B testing. Everyone loves a good hypothesis right?
  I know I do. Melding the world of science and software can help alleviate the stresses
  of experiments and help to maximize impact of every feature. In this talk we will
  journey through what an A/B test is, defining goals for A/B testing your app, and
  rolling out features based on successful experiments.'
