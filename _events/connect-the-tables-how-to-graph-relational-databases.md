title: 'Connect the Tables: How to Graph Relational Databases'
description: "You might have heard about graphs, but what if you already have a relational
  database? How do you incorporate something new? This session will show you how to
  translate part or all data from a relational format into a graph.\r\n\r\nWe will
  cover the basics of migrating the model and practical steps for actually implementing
  it. We will walk through naming and case conventions for graphs, as well as some
  principles for a successful graph model. At each step, we will show live code for
  making this work in the real world. Come to this session to get concrete steps for
  graphing relational databases."
