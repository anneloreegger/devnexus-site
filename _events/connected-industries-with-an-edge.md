title: Connected Industries with an Edge
description: "Manufacturing facilities, production lines, and industrial automation
  units have traditionally been disconnected from the internet. However, to stay competitive
  in the digital era, these systems must evolve into smart, interconnected networks
  by integrating key technologies such as digital twins and the Industrial Internet
  of Things (IIoT), which require internet connectivity and the cloud.\r\n\r\nAs data
  volumes generated by industrial equipment are substantial, relying solely on cloud
  infrastructure becomes insufficient due to bandwidth limitations, latency issues,
  and the inability to handle real-time data processing effectively. Even more, it
  poses key security challenges/ This is where edge computing becomes critical. Edge
  computing brings data processing closer to the source, reducing latency and bandwidth
  strain, enabling faster decision-making and seamless operations.\r\n\r\nThis talk
  explores how industrial automation can safely and efficiently move online by leveraging
  edge computing and highlights the features that application servers should offer
  to meet the demands of operational technologies and factory environments, such as
  security, reliability, scalability, and long-term support. The presentation showcase
  these opportunities through a demo build with Payara Platform.\r\n"
