Records are a special type of class that will become final in Java 16. Their close coupling of immutable state and API makes them suitable for several use cases, one of them being serialization. This talk will introduce Records and the concept of serialization, before demonstrating how the properties of record classes can be leveraged to improve the security, maintainability and the overall efficiencies of serialization.
