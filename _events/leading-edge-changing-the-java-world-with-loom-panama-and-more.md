title: Leading Edge! Changing the Java World with Loom, Panama, and More
description: So many new toys! Over the past several years, JVM engineers have quietly
  started to land the largest and most important features in the history of Java.
  Project Loom brings "virtual threads", lightweight userland concurrency and massive
  horizontal scaling. Project Panama brings native function and memory support, blurring
  the lines between Java and native languages like C. And there's even more coming
  soon. We'll explore how JVM languages like JRuby can leverage these and other features,
  and talk about what the future holds.
