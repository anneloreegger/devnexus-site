title: 'Harnessing the Power of Open Source for Cloud Native Development: Strategies
  for Success'
description: "As cloud native architectures become increasingly popular, open source
  tools have become essential for managing and deploying cloud native applications.
  Whether you are a developer, architect, or IT professional, this talk will provide
  valuable insights and guidance for leveraging open source tools in your own cloud
  native initiatives. Mo Haghighi, will explore some of the most popular open source
  tools for cloud native development such as Kubernetes, Prometheus and Grafana that
  work together complementarily to orchestrate, log activities and monitor containers.
  \r\nWe will begin with an introduction to cloud native architecture and the benefits
  of microsevices architecture. He will then dig into the key challenges faced by
  organizations looking to adopt cloud native technologies.\r\nWe will then dive into
  open source tools that work efficiently with Kubernetes, an open source container
  orchestration platform that simplifies the management of containerized applications.\r\nMo
  will specifically discuss open source monitoring systems such as Prometheus and
  Grafana to get detailed and visualised insights into the health of microservices.
  \r\nThe main focus of the talk will be to educate attendees on the benefits of using
