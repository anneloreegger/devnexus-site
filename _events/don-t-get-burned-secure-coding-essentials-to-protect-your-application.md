title: Don't Get Burned! Secure Coding Essentials to protect your application
description: As a developer, you understand the importance of writing code that is
  functional, scalable, and maintainable. But how about secure code? Even the most
  seasoned developer can make common security mistakes that leave your code vulnerable
  to attack. In this session, we'll explore the most common and sometimes unknown
  security pitfalls made by developers and provide practical tips for avoiding them.
  We'll cover everything from input validation errors to injection to file overwrites
  and arbitrary code execution. We'll show real-world examples of insecure code and
  demonstrate how attackers exploit these vulnerabilities before showing you how to
  fix these code constructions. By understanding how these mistakes get exploited,
  you'll be better equipped to write secure, bulletproof code that can withstand attacks.
  Whether you're a junior developer just starting out or a seasoned pro looking to
  brush up on your skills, this session is a must-attend for anyone concerned with
  the security of their applications. Letâ€™s start writing secure code and learn how
  to avoid security mistakes.
