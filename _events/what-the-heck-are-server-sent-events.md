title: What the Heck are Server Sent Events?
description: "Web applications frequently need to open a channel of communication
  with a server to get real-time updates. This is often done using two-way communication
  via WebSockets, but they can be complex to implement and, in many cases, are overkill.
  Server Sent Events (SSEs) offer an easy-to-implement alternative for many common
  use cases where an application only needs to receive updates.\r\n\r\nIn this session,
  we'll explore what the SSE spec is and how to implement it in a web application
  using JavaScript. We'll also take a quick look at a number of open source libraries
  LaunchDarkly maintains for implementing SSEs in Python, .NET, Go and more for server-to-server
  SSEs."
