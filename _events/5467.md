For most enterprise projects, testing is not really fun. It’s boring, cumbersome, and takes time and effort — especially for distributed applications or when changes in existing functionality forces test scenarios to adapt. Still, software tests are crucial; so, how can we tackle them in an effective and productive way?

This session shows what is necessary to effectively test Java microservices in an automated way. We’ll see which approaches work well, how to keep a fast feedback loop and constant velocity, how to manage complex test scenarios that involve multiple services, and how to verify our API contracts. One of the key aspects will be how to write maintainable test code with high quality that embraces principles of software craftsmanship. I’ll be live-coding test cases using Enterprise Java, Quarkus, Docker, and Kubernetes. Join us to improve your testing flow experience.
