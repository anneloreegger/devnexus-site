title: Start covering your bases & Stop chasing APT headlines
description: "Cognitive biases affect us in many ways, even in cyber security: we
  often focus on the recent technical buzz or address a new sensational hacking campaign
  that was discovered. But the fact of the matter is that network breaches and ransom
  attacks that happen every day, are by large executed using well-known techniques,
  tools and procedures. \r\n\r\nThis is why we are presenting a “run-of-the-mill”
  simulation of a full network breach, from initial access, to discovery, lateral
  movement and finally exfiltration. Based on public DFIR reports, MITRE’s ATT&CK
  framework and common hacking tradecraft as covered by atomic red-team tests, we
  demonstrate how attackers execute such attacks, without the need for tailor-made
  and sophisticated tools or techniques. \r\n\r\nIn addition to showing the recorded
  simulation, we’ll discuss the importance of defense-in-depth and how you should
  place multiple different tripwires to stop network breaches. In particular,  the
  significant role that network controls and detections can play in such cases."
