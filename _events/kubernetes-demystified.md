title: Kubernetes Demystified
description: "Have you heard about Kubernetes? Of course you have, is that thing that
  was created by Google to orchestrate containers. You might have heard some of its
  features, like auto-scaling, load balancing, zero downtime version releases, etc.
  And also, you might have heard the new jargon that comes with it. \r\n\r\nPods,
  nodes, replicasets, deployments, statefulsets, netpols, services, namespaces, kubectl????\r\n\r\nIf
  you are wondering what all those words mean, you are not alone! (and you probably
  need to join me in this talk)\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll start with a quick introduction
  to Kubernetes and the problems that it is trying to solve. We'll demystify terms
  like pods, deployments, services, and more. You'll gain the knowledge you need to
  navigate the Kubernetes landscape confidently, making sense of the buzzwords that
  have left you scratching your head."
