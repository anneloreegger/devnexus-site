So you've created a Java-based application with Micronaut that persists and retrieves data to your backend DB. Everything works perfectly! The client is happy, the PM is happy - everyone is happy! And then one day, the client calls the PM and says "hey, can you add Google to my site?" And the PM calls you and says "hey, you can add Google to the site in like just a few hours, right?" And in your head you're like "uhhh...no, Google is a company, not an open-source Java module" but you say to the PM "sure, we can add full-text search to the site!" What's that? You've never worked with full-text search before? Then this session is for you!
