title: Don't Trust anyone.... Secure your Microservices with ZeroTrust approach.
description: "Edge trusting is dead, long live Zero Trust.\r\n\r\nWe were used to
  deal with `edge security` , direct integration with IDPs using different libraries,
  also dealing with certificates, SSL, securing the point of entrance to our system,
  and after that.... well, if you are in the system is because you are allowed to
  ...... or not ?\r\n\r\nNowadays CVEs, massive attacks, are common .... for sure
  you remember some recent cases ....don't you ?\r\n\r\nSo, the idea of protecting
  only the most external layer of our system , based on the idea that nobody can be
  in the system if that gate has not been successfully passed, is no longer valid.\r\n\r\nIn
  this session I will share my knowledge on protecting K8s and VMs clusters following
  the ZeroTrust approach, covering concepts like : Zero Trust security, SSL transport,
  Observability, Authz and Authn , and everything without touching a single line of
  our Java ( Quarkus ) microservices and how to change that configuration without
  telling a word to the app developer."
