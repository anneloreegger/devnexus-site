Think back over your career as a software developer. How many great--and I mean truly great--software developers have you worked with? The chances are you can count them on one hand? What sets these legends apart from the rest? What does it take to be considered truly great? Michael can certainly tell you what NOT to doâ€¦ from cold, bitter experience.

Ego Driven Development is a humorous and brutally honest look at a career spanning over two decades. We dive into war stories, train wrecks and so many misguided attempts at greatness. There is a path to becoming a truly great software engineer, but it's not always where we first look. Wrap up a day of DevNexus with laughs, perspective, and inspiration for the future.
