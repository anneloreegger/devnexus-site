title: What Makes Software Architecture So Intractable?
description: " Why can't we make software architecture once and for all? Why do we
  keep having to make the seemingly same decisions over and over again? This keynote
  delves into the slippery nature of software architecture decisions and the modern
  way to do trade-off analysis. I show tips and techniques for assessing architecture
  trade-offs, as well as some easy-to-fall-into anti-patterns. I also discuss iterative
  architectureâ€“the faster you can get feedback for your trade-off analysis, the easier
  you can make architecture decisions based on objective reality, not opinions."
