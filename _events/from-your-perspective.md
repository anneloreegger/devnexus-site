title: From Your Perspective
description: "There are countless practical applications of 3D transforms.  Too often
  3D is a buzzword for a large, flashy framework, and not a simpler way to present
  information.  Behind complex linear algebra is simple intuition that you already
  have and can use.  In this presentation, I will review the ideas of matrix transforms
  without the headache.  Everyone, from academic to beginner will have a clearer understanding
  of the world, both virtual and real.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we review the tiny bits
  of math that masquerade as magic so that everyone feels like they gained superpowers."
