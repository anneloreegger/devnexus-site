Git is not only popular, it's powerful - but the learning curve is steep.  In this workshop, you'll learn (or quickly revisit) basic Git commands, then move into day-to-day git functionality as well as more advanced commands that will help you protect your code, work better as a team, and help you recover from a "Git pickle".
