title: How to choose the right database for your application
description: In this talk, we will review the strengths and qualities of each database
  type from their particular use-case perspectives. Although having everything in
  one database seems like the straightforward path, it is not always the most cost
  or time effective path. Many Databases have become more specialized for the types
  of data they handle. Learn how to make the right choice for your workloads with
  this walkthrough of a set of distinct database types (graph, in-memory, search,
  columnar, document, relational, key-value, and time series databases). Learn about
  current trends in the database ecosystem and then learn about a number of different
  specialized databases and their strengths and weaknesses. This presentation will
  go over some of the fastest growing segments in the database space.
