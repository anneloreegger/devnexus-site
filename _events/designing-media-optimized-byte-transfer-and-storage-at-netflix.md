title: Designing media optimized byte transfer and storage at Netflix
description: "Netflix is a media streaming company and a movie studio with data at
  exabyte scale. Most of the data generated, transferred and stored at Netflix is
  very media specific, for example, raw camera footage, or data generated as a result
  of encoding and rendering for different screen types.\r\n\r\nIn this session, I
  will throw light on how we design a media aware and optimized transfer, storage
  and presentation layer for data.\r\n\r\nBy leveraging this architecture at Netflix
  scale, we provide a scalable, reliable, and optimized backend layer for media data.\r\n\r\nMajor
  takeaways from this session\r\n- Learn about the challenges of designing a scalable
  object storage layer for data while adhering to the file system POSIX semantics
  of media applications\r\n- Learn about the optimizations applied to reduce cloud
  storage footprint, such as chunking, deduplication\r\n- Learn about how different
  applications expect data to be presented at different locations and in different
  formats.\r\n"
