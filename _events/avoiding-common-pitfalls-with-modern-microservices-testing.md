title: Avoiding common pitfalls with modern microservices testing
description: "Have you ever wondered why your microservices break in production after
  all the tests have passed during CI/CD? Have you ever wondered if you’re testing
  too much or too little? If you want to learn about common pitfalls and how to catch
  them at build time rather than at runtime, this session is for you!\r\n\r\nIn this
  session, we’ll share some common battle scars from our experiences in the field.
  Additionally, we will introduce the testing pyramid and explain why it is important
  in helping to continuously deploy microservices independently without fear. We will
  demonstrate, through a test-driven development approach, how the combination of
  Pact contract testing combined with Quarkus developer joy can help prevent your
  microservices from breaking in production"
