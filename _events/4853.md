<p>Everybody seems to be talking about reactive, but do you really grasp it? All the talks and examples make it look "simple", and different, but how do I transfer my traditional skills to this new paradigm?</p>

<p>Come and join us on this session so you can learn how to transition from imperative to reactive programming. I've had a hard time myself trying to understand how things work. But fortunately I'lll help you to understand how concepts like sync and async programming, reactive, streams, message queues and brokers, and reactive systems fit together. Confused? Well, you won't be anymore after this talk.</p>
