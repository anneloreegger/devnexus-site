title: Climbing Up with Alpine.js
description: 'Every modern web site requires some degree of interactivity, but for
  many projects large frameworks like React or Vue can be overly complex and unnecessary.
  Alpine.js offers a much simpler, but still powerful, solution to this that aims
  to be like "jQuery for the modern web." In this talk, I''ll introduce Alpine and
  explain where it makes the most sense to use it. I''ll walk through the basic syntax
  and then demonstrate examples of how Alpine can progressively enhance web pages
  to add interactivity. '
