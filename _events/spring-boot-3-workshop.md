  you will learn the fundamentals of the new features available in the Spring portfolio
  and also application observability mainly with Micrometer. We will cover the latest
  developments in Spring Framework 6, Spring Boot 3, and Micrometer. You will apply
  these fundamentals to realistic scenarios in sample applications where having observability
  is crucial. You will learn how to Migrate from Boot 2.x to 3, what new features
  are available, how to use the new AOT and GraalVM native-image support, how to effectively
  handle errors, how to integrate applications over HTTP via the new Interface Clients,
  how to avoid common issues, how to make these apps observable, what observability
  signals to watch, and how to integrate metrics with distributed tracing and logs.\r\nThis
  workshop is for people who want to learn about Spring Boot 3, Spring Framework 6
  and observability. What new tools to use and how to use them with the applications
  they write so that they can face the cruel world of production.\r\n\r\nPrerequisites:\r\n-
  Very basic Spring Boot knowledge (how to create beans and HTTP endpoints), you can
  learn these from our online guides quickly, e.g.: https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/\r\n-
