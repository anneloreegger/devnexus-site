title: Crossing The Streams - leveraging Pulsar IO + Pulsar Functions together with
  Spring Cloud Stream
description: "Apache® Pulsar™ is an open-source, distributed messaging and streaming
  platform built for the cloud. It provides Pulsar Functions and Pulsar IO connectors
  which can be leveraged to build Pulsar message processing applications.\r\nSpring
  Cloud Stream is a framework for building message-driven micro-service applications.
  It provides a Pulsar binder implementation that can be used to build Pulsar message-processing
  applications.\r\nBoth of these solutions share a high degree of feature overlap
  and either could be used to solve the same problem. However, it need not be an ‘either-or’
  proposition, they can actually be used in tandem.\r\nIn this talk, we will demonstrate
  Pulsar Functions and Pulsar IO connectors and show how Spring for Apache Pulsar
  simplifies their usage.  We will also show how to use the Spring Cloud Stream Pulsar
  Binder in your application.  Finally, we will “cross the streams” and leverage these
  technologies together to build a Pulsar message processing application."
