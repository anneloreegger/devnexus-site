title: 'Serverless Java in Action: Cloud Agnostic Design Patterns and Tips'
description: "You've probably seen how to create a Function-as-a-Service with one
  of the cloud providers, but if this is all you know about Serverless, prepare to
  have your mind blown!\r\nIn this session we'll show you how to create a production-grade,
  cloud-agnostic, event-driven serverless solution with Quarkus, a Java stack optimized
  for fast startup and small footprint; and Knative, an open source community project
  for deploying, running and managing serverless applications on Kubernetes.   Say
  goodbye to vendor lock-in and hello to Supersonic Subatomic Java-based Serverless
  bliss!\r\n"
