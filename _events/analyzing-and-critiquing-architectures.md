title: Analyzing and Critiquing Architectures
description: Software architecture is having a moment, from best selling books to
  packed classes, the software industry acknowledges the importance of the parts of
  software resistant to internet searches. Ample pixels have been spilt talking about
  patterns, decomposition, styles, diagrams and more and all to good ends! But when
  it comes time to review an architecture, what should you do? What factors should
