title: 'JakartaEE meets AI: Beyond the chatbot with Langchain4j'
description: "LLMs are getting smarter every day, but they still don’t get the ins
  and outs of your business.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll explore a demo project
  built with JakartaEE and Langchain4j where we’ll supercharge the LLMs by hooking
  them up to your backend. The result? An LLM that not only chats but also follows
  your business rules, making it a real game-changer for your applications."
