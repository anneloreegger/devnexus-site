After creating your first microservice and putting it into production, you heard a lot of people talking about reactive. You'd like to find out more about reactive and have several questions: Why should I care? What I can do to make my microservice reactive, nonblocking? How can I use CompletionStage in my microservices? Should I consider using Reactive Streams? Come to this session to find out what reactive means. It explains reactive programming and then Reactive Streams, followed by a demo of using MicroProfile Fault Tolerance, MicroProfile Reactive Streams Operators, and MicroProfile Reactive Messaging to create a truly reactive microservice and integrate with Kafka.
