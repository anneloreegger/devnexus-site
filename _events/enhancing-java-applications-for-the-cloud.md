title: Enhancing Java applications for the cloud
description: Are you in the process of modernizing your business from a monolith to
  an agile micro-service oriented model in the cloud? Or is your application already
  cloud-native? There are different performance concerns that need to be taken into
  account when deploying to the cloud in comparison to traditional deployments. With
  serverless and FaaS models, startup time and memory footprint play a big role, as
  it determines the cost of deploying to the cloud. Come to this session to learn
  more about how technologies like checkpoint/restore and remote JIT compilation can
  help boost startup time and reduce memory footprint to minimize your costs. You'll
  also learn how these features integrate seamlessly with existing container technologies
  for simple, secure and predictable deployments. Whether you are a cloud veteran
  or a new comer, there will be lots to learn!
