title: Reading code
description: "As developers, we spend a lot of time learning to write code, while
  spending little to no time learning to read code. Meanwhile, we often spend more
  time reading code than actually writing it. Shouldnâ€™t we be spending at least the
  same amount of time and effort improving this skill? Deliberate practice can help
  us get better at reading code. Learning how to better read and understand code,
  can in turn teach us what makes code readable. This might even help us to write
  code that is easier to read.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will discuss the benefits of
  deliberately practicing reading code in a code reading club or session without an
  IDE, as well as common strategies to navigate a new codebase and familiarise ourselves
  with the code using the IDE."
