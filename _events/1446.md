Spring Boot 2.0 introduces a host of new features and whole lot of behind the scenes changes. This talk will cover all the major improvements, show you how to migrate and Boot 1.5 application and discuss some of the smaller tweaks and utilities that you might not be aware of.

The talk will also cover some of the changes we made to the Spring Boot internals, discuss why we made them, and how they will help with future releases.
