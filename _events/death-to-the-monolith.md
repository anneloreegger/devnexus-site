title: Death to the Monolith
description: "Monolithic architecture has been the traditional approach for building
  web applications, but it often leads to a rigid, inflexible, and slow development
  process. Micro-frontends, on the other hand, allows for breaking down large, complex
  applications into smaller, more manageable pieces that can be developed, tested,
  and deployed independently. In this talk, we will learn how to say \"death to the
  monolith\" and embrace micro-frontends as an architecture pattern.\r\n\r\nBy exploring
  the problems with monolithic architecture we will discuss why it's time to move
  away from it. A monolithic architecture can lead to a lack of agility, difficulty
  in scaling, and an increased risk of failure. Meanwhile, a micro-frontend architecture
  pattern allows for a more flexible, scalable, and efficient development process.\r\n\r\nNext,
  we will look at how an application composition platform provides a framework for
  creating and managing micro-frontends, including tools for versioning, testing,
  and deploying them. We will discuss how an application composition platform can
  help ensure consistency across micro-frontends by providing a centralized location
  for managing shared resources.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will learn how embracing micro-frontend
  architecture with an application composition platform can enable organizations to
  become more agile and efficient. Additionally, we will explore how micro-frontend
  architecture can enable rapid prototyping, reduce time to market, and allow for
  easier scaling of applications.\r\n\r\nAttendees of this talk will leave with a
  deeper understanding of the problems with monolithic architecture and the benefits
  of micro-frontend architecture. They will gain practical tips and strategies for
  building micro-frontends that are flexible, maintainable, and optimized for performance
  using an application composition platform. They will also learn how embracing micro-frontend
  architecture can enable organizations to become more agile and efficient in their
  development process.\r\n"
