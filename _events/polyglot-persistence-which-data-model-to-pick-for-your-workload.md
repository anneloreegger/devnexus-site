title: Polyglot persistence - which data model to pick for your workload?
description: JSON, Graph, Relational, or just Key/Value? Which data model should you
  pick for your app to use? Does it matter? What are the benefits, what the trade-offs?
  So many choices and yet no good answers out there on the web. Look no further! In
  this talk you will learn the concepts of each of the popular data models, where
  they shine and where they shouldn't be your first choice.
