description: 'Serverless cloud computing provides you with an infrastructure out of
  the box to run your containerized Java microservices highly efficiently. With MicroProfile
  and GraalVM, Java integrates seamlessly with serverless infrastructure and leads
  to strong benefits: higher efficiency, endless scalability, high availability, and
  the lowest possible effort for the development, production usage, administration,
  and maintenance of cloud-native Java applications.'
