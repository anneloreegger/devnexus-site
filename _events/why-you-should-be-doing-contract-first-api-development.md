title: Why You Should Be Doing Contract First API Development
description: How do you develop APIs and services efficiently and effectively while
  improving software quality and team productivity? That's called contract-first API
  development! By using tools like OpenAPI specification and generator tooling capable
  of leveraging it, you can leap ahead in your development by generating lots of the
  boilerplate code, some of your tests, and allowing multiple parallel workstreams
  within your team. In this session I will show you examples of how you can fast track
  your API and service development today!
