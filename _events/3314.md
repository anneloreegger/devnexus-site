As more and more projects start incorporating reactive programming, they start to discover that the only way to get the full benefit of that change is to ensure that they have a fully reactive stack. There are a number of messaging systems and data stores that enable this fully reactive stack, but there has been a big piece missing when it comes to accessing relational database systems in a fully reactive way. This talk presents the Reactive Relational Database Connectivity (R2DBC) project. The project is a test-bed for what a reactive API would look like when paired with relational database access. This talk will explain how the API works, the benefits of using it, and how it contrasts with the ADBC project proposed as a successor to JDBC.
