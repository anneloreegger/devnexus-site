title: Simple Ways to Make Webhook Security Better
description: Webhooks are a simple and powerful way for services to notify each other
  that something interesting has happened. So much so that it became the most popular
  mechanism for communicating events. While webhooks give us power and flexibility,
  they rely heavily on the listener to enforce security. In this session, we will
  learn the most common, interesting, and challenging patterns across 100+ webhook
  implementations, and learn some simple ways to make webhook security better (for
  providers and consumers).
