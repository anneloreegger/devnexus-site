title: Bootiful Spring Boot 3.x
description: "Spring Framework 6.x and Spring Boot 3.x are almost here and you know
  what that means? New .jars! And also new baselines and new possibilities! Spring
  Framework implies a Java 17 and Jakarta EE baseline, and offers new support for
  building GraalVM-native images. It also offers a new observability layer, an amalgamation
  of some of the work in the Micrometer project and Spring Cloud Sleuth. Spring Boot
  3 builds upon all of this, and integrates all of this into our application. Join
  me, Spring Developer Advocate Josh Long (@starbuxman), and we'll look at next-gen
  Spring and learn why, with Spring taken together with Java 21, there's never been
  a better time to Java developer.\r\n\r\n"
