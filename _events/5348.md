Solving certain types of problems can take billions of years on our current conventional computers. Quantum computers, however, could potentially solve these types of problems in just seconds. Quantum computers have the potential to impact many fields, such as machine learning, medicine, and energy systems. How do quantum computers work? How do you program a quantum computer? How much progress have we made? What is possible in the future? Jessica Pointing will explore these questions and more during this primer on quantum computing.
