title: 'API Management as Code: A declarative approach to handling API artifacts'
description: "Every day software development relies more and more on APIs. Using it
  as part of digital transformation or just to connect some microservices, developers
  use APIs to connect applications and devices. API management is now a mature discipline
  covering the different aspects of the API lifecycle. However, managing efficiently
  the surge of APIs in the organization could be a challenge. Using a declarative
  approach makes it easier to understand and automate the desired state of APIs. It
  makes it easier to version, review and share with other members of the team. Some
  projects have started to complement their capabilities to add this declarative approach,
  usually in environments like Kubernetes. \r\n\r\nJoin this session to learn more
  about:\r\n\r\nCommon API management artifacts\r\nAn introduction to declarative
  vs imperative management\r\nThe operator pattern and how it helps with declarative
  management\r\nAn example from the 3scale operator\r\nOther projects using Kubernetes
  custom resources.\r\n"
