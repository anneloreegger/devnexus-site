title: Architectural Resiliency
description: Regardless of the techniques used to make enterprise solutions Highly
  Available (HA), failure at some point inevitable. Resiliency is how fast a system
  reacts and then recovers to such failures. Failure of Highly Available (HA) enterprise
  solutions is inevitable. This presentation covers a number of architectural resiliency
  techniques and patterns that help increase Mean Time to Failure (MTTF), a.k.a Fault
  Tolerance and decrease Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR).
