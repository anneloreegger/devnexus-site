title: Minimum Viable Security for Cloud Native Stacks
description: "The migration from monoliths to microservices is long behind us, however
  managing microservices operations at scale comes with a layer of complexity, particularly
  with aspects of security that still have a learning curve.  But what if all of this
  could be simplified and automated pretty easily?\r\n\r\nIf we think about our production
  microservices operations, in the same way we think about how we design and build
  our products, we could build and automate minimum viable security plans that we
  could easily bake into our config files and CI/CD processes.  Once we build this
  foundational framework of security, it will always be possible to iterate and evolve
  our security framework, for advanced layers of security that often comes with time,
  increased experience, and greater maturity around security.\r\n\r\nIn this talk,
  we will present what MVS looks like for microservices operations, how to build a
  cluster secured by design, continuously monitoring networking,  container internals
  and primitives, and access management with a least privilege principle mindset.
  In this session we will demonstrate this through code, and even how this can work
  seamlessly with other ecosystem projects - from Helm to OPA, ArgoCD, Notary or Github
  Actions, Terraform, and AWS."
