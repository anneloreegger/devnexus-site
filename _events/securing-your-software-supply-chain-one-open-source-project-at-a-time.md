title: Securing Your Software Supply Chain One Open Source Project at a Time
description: "Delivering software fast is one piece of the CI/CD puzzle, but delivering
  it securely is the glue that keeps your puzzle from falling apart. Software supply
  chain attacks are on the rise with security exploits directly targeting open source
  projects, central repositories, and software package managers. Now that developers
  are the target of security attackers, how do you protect your DevOps pipeline?\r\n\r\nThis
  is a problem that the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF)  is working to solve..
  To help ensure a secure SDLC, the CDF is investing in projects that provide security
  solutions and in 2022 announced a new incubating project, Pyrsia. This talk will
  highlight the importance of securing your software supply chain at the source and
  how Pyrsia is working to solve this problem."
