title: Five ways open source will slow you down
description: "Software is changing the world - and even other planets. An ever-growing
  part of software is “open source”. But it hasn’t always been that way! And “doing
  something open source” is definitely no guarantee for success. There are numerous
  ways in which you can use open-source software and be worse off than if you did
  not.\r\n\r\nJoin me in this talk to find out how not to leverage open-source software
  in your organisation and your projects. Find out why reading the documentation may
  not always be your best bet, or how a workaround may eventually work against you.
  By investigating 5 ways in which you can fail, we can learn valuable lessons on
  what to do instead."
