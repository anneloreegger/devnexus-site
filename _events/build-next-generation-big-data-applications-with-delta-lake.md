title: Build next generation Big Data applications with Delta Lake
description: "    Delta Lake (https://delta.io/) is an open-source storage framework
  that enables building a Lakehouse architecture with compute engines including Spark
  and also APIs for Scala/Java, Python and Rust. A Lakehouse is a modern data architecture
  that reimagines data warehouses in response to the availability of affordable and
  highly reliable storage solutions. \r\n\r\n    Delta Lake provides key benefits
  and will fit perfectly in your Big Data architecture:\r\n     - ACID Transactions\r\n
  \    - Schema Evolution\r\n     - Time Travel\r\n     - Audit History\r\n     -
  Handle petabyte-scale tables\r\n     - Platform Agnostic (Cloud, On-prem, or locally)\r\n
  \    - DML operations through its SQL and Spark API \r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n    In
  this presentation, I will provide an introduction to Delta Lake, explaining how
  it works, and its key features and benefits. Whether you're a data scientist, data
  engineer, or business analyst, this session is for you."
