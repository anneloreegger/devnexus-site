We present how the Graal project enhances the Java ecosystem with an integrated, polyglot, high-performance execution environment for dynamic, static, and native languages. Graal supports Java, Scala, Kotlin, Groovy, and other JVM-based languages. At the same time, it can run the dynamic scripting languages JavaScript including node.js, Ruby, R, and Python. Furthermore, it integrates C, C++, and other LLVM-based native languages into the same runtime environment. Graal can either run embedded in the Java HotSpot VM or as a standalone alternative with low footprint and fast startup for embedded or serverless computing environments. This talk covers the architecture of Graal and gives live demonstrations of its unique capabilities.
