    How to create applications that are Kube-Native
    How to leverage existing tools to be more productive when developing Java applications
    How to adapt application configuration for smooth Kubernetes deployment
    How to define custom health checks
    Deployment strategies
    Sizing resource limits and requests
    Kubernetes and Java integration testing
