title: How Composable Architectures can actually solve the reasons for Microservices
description: Many companies today want a faster time-to-market, more flexibility,
  and scalability for their digital services. Investments are often made in IT for
  this, such as a “migration to the cloud” and developing “microservices”. However,
  the result is often that such a transition and development becomes more complex
  and more expensive, instead of being able to take advantage of the anticipated benefits.
  So what causes this? Which aspect is missing from the application of cloud infrastructure
  and microservices? What can you do to make them beneficial? This is where Composable
  Architecture comes in! In this session, I will 1) Elaborate on Composable Architecture
  and how we got there; 2) Define the value of applying composable architectures using
  the Composable Enterprise as a framework; 3) Share how I applied Composable Architectures
  in projects, and what I learned from it
