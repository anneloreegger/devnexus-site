title: Empowering Developers to Embrace Security
description: In this talk, I will show you why it is important to empower developers
  to make secure decisions from the beginning. Good communication and collaboration
  between security and development teams will improve developer adoption. We need
  to combine a collaborative culture with the right process and the right tooling
  to enable developers to build their applications more securely.
