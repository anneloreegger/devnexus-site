Docker is the de facto tool for creating containerized applications, but leveraging containers in production isn't always straightforward. There are many options from simple hosts to complex orchestration tools. Learn how to create Docker images, load them to a custom registry and deploy them at scale with a simple example application written in Go and JavaScript. See examples of cloud deployments implemented with Azure Container Instances, Web Apps for Containers, and Azure Kubernetes Services.
