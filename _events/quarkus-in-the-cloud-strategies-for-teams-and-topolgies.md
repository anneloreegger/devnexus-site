title: 'Quarkus in the Cloud: Strategies for Teams and Topolgies'
description: 'Java is a powerhouse of a language suitable for use in many environments,
  footprints, and form-factors. As we collectively learn more about how to write cloud
  applications, we''re seeing more nuanced discussions about how we build applications:
  should we be using monoliths or microservices? Should I use cloud functions? What
  is a modular monolith and is it a good idea or not?  These choices require thoughtful
  architectural decisions and optimization strategies, not only at the code level
  but also in fostering effective teamwork. This talk delves deep into the architectural
  nuances and trade-offs essential for making informed decisions in these deployment
  paradigms.'
