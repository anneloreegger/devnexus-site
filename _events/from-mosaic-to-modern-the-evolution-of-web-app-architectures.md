title: 'From Mosaic to Modern: The Evolution of Web App Architectures'
description: "The introduction of the NCSA Mosaic browser in 1993 marked the inception
  of the modern web. What began as a platform for static hypertext documents rapidly
  evolved, embracing dynamic content, interactive functionality, and eventually the
  extensive capabilities of today's rich web applications. In this session, we will:\r\n\r\n*
  Explore the pivotal shifts in web application architectures from the early 1990s
  to the present.\r\n* Highlight the successful strategies, acknowledge the missteps,
  and identify the driving factors behind each architectural choice.\r\n* Offer insights
  into the repeated patterns and lessons learned from history.\r\n\r\nWith a keen
  understanding of the past, attendees will be better poised to approach future web
  development challenges with clarity and confidence. Join this journey through time
  to gain a deeper appreciation of the web's evolution and prepare for what lies ahead."
