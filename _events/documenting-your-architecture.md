title: Documenting your architecture
description: "We've all learned that documenting your code is a good idea. But what
  about your architecture? What should we be thinking about when we document architecture?
  What tools and techniques can we reach for as we pursue this endeavor? Can we even
  make this a sustainable activity, or are we forever doomed to architectural documentation
  getting outdated before the ink is even dry? \r\n\r\nIn this session we will discuss
  a range of techniques that will not only help document your architecture, but even
  provide a mechanism to think about architecture upfront, and make it more predictable.
  You'll walk away armed with everything you need to know about documenting your current,
  and future architectures. "
