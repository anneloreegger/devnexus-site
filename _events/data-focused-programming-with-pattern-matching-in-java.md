title: Data Focused programming with Pattern Matching in Java
description: "Data is at the heart of most applications. For ages, Java developers
  have been using conditions to determine whether an instance is of a specific type
  - to extract its components. Though this sounds obvious and harmless, Pattern Matching
  has revolutionized how you achieve this in your everyday code in a concise and focused
  way.\r\n\r\nWorking with its syntax seems simple and straightforward. Pattern Matching
  can be used with operators like instanceof, and constructs like switch statements
  and expressions. But, don't let this simplicity deceive you. Its real power lies
  in understanding the semantics of working with Patterns like Type Patterns, Parenthesized
  Patterns, Record Patterns and others to write declarative and data-focused code
  to create powerful, declarative and composable data navigation and processing. \r\n\r\nIn
  this live-coded talk, the attendees will learn about the issues with their existing
  code, create concise and clear data-focused queries, and modify existing code bases
  to avail benefits of Pattern Matching."
