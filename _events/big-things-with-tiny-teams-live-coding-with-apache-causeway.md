title: 'Big things with tiny teams : Live coding with Apache Causeway'
description: "I came across the naked objects pattern at a conference in 2002, and
  2 years later we used an early version of the Naked Objects Framework to build the
  main benefits system for the Irish Government, still running 20+ years later and
  administering pensions and 40 other benefits.  And since 2012 we've developed an
  in-house ERP for Eurocommercial Properties on that early framework's successor,
  Apache Causeway, processing â‚¬500m of invoices each year.  All in a team averaging
  2.5 FTE people.\r\n\r\nYou can think of naked objects a bit like an ORM, except
  it manages the presentation layer rather than persistence.  Not having to build
  the UI layer (or REST APIs) means that you can focus on what really matters, the
  core business domain.  \r\n\r\nIn this talk I'll introduce you to Apache Causeway,
  itself built upon Spring Boot, with live coding and anecdotes along the way."
