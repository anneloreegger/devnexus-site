title: The Programmer's Guide to JDK Flight Recorder
description: The JDK Flight Recorder (JFR) is an event-based diagnostic and profiling
  tool built into the JDK. JFR can provide detailed information about the performance
  of a JVM and Java applications running on it and help diagnose when something goes
  wrong in production. JFR has several powerful and flexible APIs for capturing, streaming,
  and filtering information. This presentation will focus on how programmers can take
  advantage of these APIs for testing, capturing valuable data, providing live metrics,
  and more! If you have been wondering how to improve the performance of your Java
  applications or get better insight into their internal workings, this presentation
  is for you!
