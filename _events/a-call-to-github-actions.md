title: A Call to (GitHub) Actions!
description: Since the dawn of ... the epoch?, engineers have been trying to automate
  away the boring, repetitive stuff.  These days thanks to the rise of Continuous
  Integration and Continuous Deployment practices, we've never had a richer set of
  tools.  On the flip side, it can hard to know how to wire it all up to meet your
  specific needs.  In this talk we'll cover some of these options using GitHub Actions
  and see how we can automate, and better yet reuse that automation, to make your
  project management one less reason to lay awake at night.  Join me as I share the
  lessons learned and practices developed in both my professional and personal software
  projects.
