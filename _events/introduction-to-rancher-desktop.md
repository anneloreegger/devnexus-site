title: Introduction to Rancher Desktop
description: Let's explore Rancher Desktop, a full Kubernetes development environment
  for your Desktop that is 100% free and completely Open Source.  If your development
  team is concerned about “new” licensing requirements of a popular Kubernetes Desktop
  software that is NOT Open Source, then you need to take a closer look at Rancher
  Desktop, a FOSS project backed by SUSE. Rancher Desktop runs on Linux, Windows,
  and Mac. Developers can easily change container runtimes and Kubernetes versions
  to match deployment targets.    https://rancherdesktop.io/
