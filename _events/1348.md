title: Java Microservices Patterns & Practices with Kubernetes/OpenShift and Istio
abstract: "Already familiar with the Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts and features?
  Then you're ready for the next step! Now you need to learn how Kubernetes and a
  Service Mesh (Istio) can provide you out-of-box and transparently features like
  service discovery, load balancing, tracing, and circuit breaking. Without having
  to add a single line of code or @Annotation!\r\n\r\nCome to this workshop to build
  your own small cluster of Java Microservices with Spring Boot and Eclipse Vert.x
  on top of Kubernetes/OpenShift and Istio. Then you will be able to unleash your
  developer powers on your project without having to worry too much with your infrastructure
  details anymore!"
