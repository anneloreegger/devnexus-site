Already familiar with the Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts and features? Then you're ready for the next step! Now you need to learn how Kubernetes and a Service Mesh (Istio) can provide you out-of-box and transparently features like service discovery, load balancing, tracing, and circuit breaking. Without having to add a single line of code or @Annotation!

Come to this workshop to build your own small cluster of Java Microservices with Spring Boot and Eclipse Vert.x on top of Kubernetes/OpenShift and Istio. Then you will be able to unleash your developer powers on your project without having to worry too much with your infrastructure details anymore!
