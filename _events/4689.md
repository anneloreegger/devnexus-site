Kotlin has been catching on lately as an alternative to Java because of its null safety guarantees, type inference, cross-platform support, and ease of use with Android and Spring. Not to mention the fact that it is fully interoperable with Java. Is this something you and your team should considering spending time to learn? Come to this session for an overview of Kotlin intended for Java developers. We will go over the major language features, syntax, and the Kotlin ecosystem so you'll know enough to make your own decisions by the end. You will come away from this session with enough knowledge to decide if this is something you and your team should consider adopting.
