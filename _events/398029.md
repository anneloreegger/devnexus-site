title: 'A tale of two cities: blocking code vs. non-blocking code'
description: "We don’t have to exert much mental effort when writing blocking code,
  but this has drawbacks. Non-blocking code, on the other hand, could be used to increase
  application throughput. This is why non-blocking code is recommended in many scenarios.
  Over the last two decades, many approaches have been introduced to writing code
  that does not block.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will look into those options that
  are available to us. To begin, I’ll go over the evolution of the Java concurrency
  model since its inception with the vanilla thread. Then I will introduce Future/Callable,
  and CompletableFuture, briefly go over reactive programming, and finally conclude
  with the Project Loom that was added in Java 19."
