title: Testing cloud-native applications with ease!
description: "Many applications rely on cloud solutions like AWS, Azure, and GCP.
  Testing such applications could be a nightmare of spare cloud accounts or never-ending
  environment setups. \r\n\r\nThanks to Testcontainers, we can run all the necessary
  services locally and even more programmatically control their configuration and
  lifecycle! It means you can improve your development feedback loop locally and test
  your cloud-native applications without spending a penny. \r\n\r\nIn this demo-heavy
  session, we’ll go over typical use cases cloud-native app developers struggle to
  test effectively, and look at how Testcontainers features enable working with S3,
  DynamoDB, Lambdas, Google Spanner, and others. Testing your cloud-native applications
  with Localstack and GCloud modules has never been this easy and reliable. "
