title: 'Creating Evolutionary Architecture and Design: From Problem to Solution by
  exploring patterns'
description: "Architecture is not a static representation of a system. There are several
  complexities and risks involved in creating them. One way to mitigate the risk is
  to evolve the architecture. But, there are risks of evolving as much as there are
  the risks of not evolving. In this interactive workshop we will explore a set of
  practices that we can use to mitigate the risks. Then we will dive into discussing
  some common and popular architectural patterns.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will take some
  example applications and discuss how to evolve architecture to meet the needs of
  those applications."
