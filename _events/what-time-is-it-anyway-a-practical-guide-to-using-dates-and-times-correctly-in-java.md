title: What Time Is It, Anyway? A Practical Guide To Using Dates And Times Correctly
  In Java
description: "The most poorly understood and incorrectly used APIs in Java that I
  have seen in my years as a consultant at multiple companies is the Java Date-Time
  APIs. Even though the APIs were introduced 10 years ago in Java 8, I still see programmers
  using the older Date class, I've seen horrific misuse of the Java 8 Date Time APIs,
  and I have had to correct issues with both production code and test code due to
  fundamental understandings of the APIs. This presentation gives a crash course into
  the proper use of the Java Date-Time APIs, why they are needed, and how (and when)
  to properly apply them.\r\n\r\nAttendees will learn the basics of how to properly
  specify a date and time in Java. They will learn when to use local date/times and
  when to use zoned date/times. They will be introduced to ISO 8601 and see how to
  properly parse and format dates in a thread safe manner.   The use of ZoneIds and
  OffsetDateTimes will be explained. Attendees will learn to use the Period and Duration
  classes to  calculate the difference between two dates or times. Finally, some pointers
  will be given on properly using dates and times in unit tests.\r\n\r\nThe goal for
  this presentation is for attendees to be able to confidently and correctly use dates
  and times in Java instead of blindly copying and pasting code from the Internet."
