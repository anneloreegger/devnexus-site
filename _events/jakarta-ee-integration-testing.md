title: Jakarta EE integration testing
description: "Integration testing is difficult as you need additional systems, like
  a database, with a predefined set of data to have repeatable tests.\r\n\r\nWith
  the availability of the Testcontainers framework, developers can test the real application
  by deploying it in a container using the runtime that will be used in production
  and dependencies available in other containers.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we explore
  a few scenarios of how you can use the Testcontainers framework to test your Jakarta
  EE application, including a remote debug session of your code."
