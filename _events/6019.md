In recent years, the interest and use of web components in the community have increased significantly. Most front-end frameworks adopt the Web Component standard, and many developers have started using the norm when creating their widgets. Not to mention that it is now natively supported by all modern browsers. How to use the interoperability and flexibility of web components as Java developers on the server-side? This talk shows the use of pure client-side web components using Java on the server-side.

We will have a look at the tech-stack, how it looks like for a developer and how to harden against known vulnerabilities.
