title: Apache Pinot Real-Time Analytics Workshop
description: "Apache Pinot is a high-performance database designed to serve analytical
  queries at extremely high concurrency, with latencies as low as tens of milliseconds.
  It specializes in ingesting streaming data from sources like Apache Kafka. It is
  an OLAP database but one optimized for user-facing features rather than manager-facing
  dashboards. \r\nIn this workshop, we will examine the inner workings of Pinot, then
  work together to set up a local Pinot cluster and put it to use. We will begin by
  uploading some static data and querying it. Next, we will deploy a local Kafka cluster
  to feed streaming data into Pinot, allowing us to incorporate real-time data into
  our analytics. We will join these two data sources in Pinot and explore how to expose
  our brand-new real-time analytics to an application front-end. \r\n"
