Deployments today are built piecemeal, using technologies and languages chosen for their appropriate application for a specific function, as opposed to just being “the language in which the application is written.” In similar fashion, they’re deployed across a broad range of platforms. In this talk, we’ll will go over some of the concerns that such a sprawling architecture needs to take into account.  We’ll cover some of issues involving polyglot environments (such as common data structures and network endpoints) and some potential solutions, gained through experience, for addressing those concerns.
