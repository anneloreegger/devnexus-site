With microservices architectures, we’re making more network calls and need to do more integration to get our system to work; this creates more ways for our applications to break and cause failures to propagate much faster. We need a way to call our microservices and be resilient to distributed systems failures — as a first-class implementation. Netflix OSS, Stubby, Finalge, et al were the first-generation of implementations to solve these problems. We'll see in this talk how Istio service mesh is the next evolution of solutions to these problems.
