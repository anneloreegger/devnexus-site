title: The Anatomy of Java Vulnerabilities
description: "Java is everywhere. According to Oracle, it’s on 4 billion devices and
  counting.\r\n\r\nAs we’ve seen with vulnerabilities like Log4Shell, keeping up to
  date with patches is critical, but each time you do, it’s an opportunity to break
  your code or let a new vulnerability in.\r\n\r\nHow do you decide what to patch
  and what to ignore?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, you’ll learn about Java vulnerabilities
  in general: what a ‘vulnerability’ actually is, how they are discovered, reported,
  managed, assessed and fixed as well as hearing a little about the specifics of attack
  vectors and bad actors. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding how to choose your dependencies more
  wisely to reduce your exposure and keep your application working is a skill we all
  need to grow - start here to begin that journey.\r\n"
