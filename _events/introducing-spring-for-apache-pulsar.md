title: Introducing Spring for Apache Pulsar
description: "Spring for Apache Pulsar is a library that makes it easy to create stand-alone,
  production-grade Spring based Applications using Apache Pulsar that you can \"just
  run\". \r\n\r\nIn this talk we will explore Spring for Apache Pulsar by looking
  at the core features that it provides. We will see how this library unlocks developer
  velocity via Spring Boot foundations when designing pub-sub solutions with Apache
  Pulsar . \r\n\r\nYou will witness a live demo where we create a basic Spring for
  Apache Pulsar app and evolve it from imperative -> reactive -> native. \r\n\r\nApache
  Pulsar is a cloud-native, multi-tenant, high-performance solution for server-to-server
  messaging and queuing built on the pub-sub pattern. Pulsar combines the best features
  of a traditional messaging system like RabbitMQ with those of a pub-sub system like
  Apache Kafka."
