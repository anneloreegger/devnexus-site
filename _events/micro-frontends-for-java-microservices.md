title: Micro Frontends for Java Microservices
description: "You've figured out how to split up your backend services into microservices
  and scale your teams to the moon, right? But what about the front end? Are you still
  building monoliths for your UI? If so, you might want to check out micro frontendsâ€”basically
  extensions to the microservices pattern, where the concept is extended to the front
  end.\r\n\r\nFind out how to package and deploy your microservices and their UIs
  in the same artifact, as well as make it possible to test and develop them independently.\r\n\r\nIn
  this live session, Matt will show you how to build a microservices and micro frontends
  architecture using React, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud."
