Ever wondered what the test coverage is for your integration tests?  Why should you even care about it if you're already looking at unit test coverage? In this talk we'll cover why you'd want to look at this metric, and how to get started. Examples will include setting up a test server inside of docker, using the JaCoCo agent on a server, and aggregating results.
