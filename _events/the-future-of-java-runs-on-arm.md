title: The future of Java runs on Arm
description: Java and Arm have always gone together, from the very early days all
  the way through the smartphone revolution. Now with Arm64 CPUs taking over the cloud
  and datacenter, keeping Java performant on this architecture is more important than

  Arm architecture.
