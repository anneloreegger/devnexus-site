title: How To Make Your JavaScript Accessible Without Losing Your Sanity (Or Your
  Hair)
description: "Accessibility is an important aspect of web development, ensuring that
  people with disabilities can access and use web applications. However, accessibility
  can often be an afterthought for developers.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will explore
  how JavaScript developers can build more accessible web applications and start by
  discussing specific techniques and tools that JavaScript developers can use to ensure
  their applications are more accessible.\r\n\r\nWe will cover topics such as basic
  accessibility, using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes, implementing keyboard accessibility,
  and testing for accessibility issues. We will also discuss how to ensure accessibility
  when working with popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks and the importance
  of designing for accessibility from the outset.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk,
  attendees will have a solid understanding of the principles of web accessibility
  and specific techniques and tools they can use to build more inclusive web applications
  with JavaScript."
