title: Work Smarter, Not Harder with your AI Coding Companion
description: "AI coding companion tools are growing in popularity, and many organizations
  are asking their development teams to use these tools with the goal of producing
  code faster and with fewer defects. However, large is the number of developers complaining
  about not being able to use them because \"they are not smart enough\" to understand
  their programming intentions. Anecdotally, this happens because, like a new developer
  during their first day in the job; there is no understanding of the existing code
  base, they have no clue about which frameworks are being used, and what is the required
  coding style.\r\n\r\nThis session will get into the weeds about how developers can
  explore the potential of AI coding companion tools by treating them as a new developer
  requiring proper onboarding. It will share day-to-day scenarios of developer problems
  and how these tools can help them if properly used. Examples will use Java, Visual
  Studio Code, and Amazon CodeWhisperer."
