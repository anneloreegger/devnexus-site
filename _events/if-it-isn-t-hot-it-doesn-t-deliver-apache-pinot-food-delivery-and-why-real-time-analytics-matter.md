title: 'If it isn''t hot, it doesn''t deliver: Apache Pinot, Food Delivery and why
  real-time analytics matter.'
description: The world IS data these days, and users need access to fresh data, delivered
  with low latency. Real-time analytics, specifically with Apache Pinot, is what makes
  it possible for Doordash to put fresh, reliable data into their users hands, and
  make sure the burger one orders arrives when expected, and is still hot! Developers
  looking to up their data game can expect great things from Pinot.
