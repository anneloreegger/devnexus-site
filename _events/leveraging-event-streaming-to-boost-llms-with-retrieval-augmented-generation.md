title: Leveraging Event Streaming to Boost LLMs with Retrieval Augmented Generation
description: "Large pre-trained language foundation models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT,
  that are pre-trained offline have been shown to store factual knowledge in their
  parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream natural
  language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely
  manipulate knowledge, especially with up-to-date knowledge, is still limited, and
  hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific
  architectures.  \r\n\r\nTo overcome such limitations, Retrieval Augmentation Generation
  (RAG) is a technique that can be utilized to retrieve data from outside a foundation
  model, and as such, it can be used for augmenting the prompts by injecting the relevant
  retrieved data into the context.   RAG has proven to be more cost-effective and
  efficient than pre-training or fine-tuning foundation models, and can help to reduce
  hallucinations in LLMs.\r\n\r\nWeâ€™ll take a look at how utilizing an event-driven
  streaming approach, by using a new open source library, LangStream, can quickly
  integrate your existing data in motion into generative AI applications such as with
  prompt engineering and the RAG pattern.  LangStream can be used with Apache Kafka
  or Apache Pulsar underneath as the event streaming and message broker platform."
