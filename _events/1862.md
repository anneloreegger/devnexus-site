This workshop will focus on the functional features introduced in Java 8 and the new capabilities added in Java 9. Topics from Java 8 will include both sequential and parallel streams, lambdas, method references, the Optional data type, functional interfaces, static and default methods in interfaces, collectors, and more. Topics from Java 9 will include the new module system using Jigsaw, the jshell REPL, private methods in interfaces, collection factory methods, and additions to the Stream, Optional, and CompletableFuture classes.

The examples and exercises will highlight the ways to write idiomatic Java using the new features. All code will be available in a GitHub repository, including Gradle build files and test cases. Coding will use the IntelliJ IDEA editor, but Eclipse support will be discussed.

Participants are expected to be comfortable with, though not necessarily experts using, versions of Java prior to Java 8.
