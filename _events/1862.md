title: 'Workshop: Upgrade to Java 8 and 9'
abstract: "This workshop will focus on the functional features introduced in Java
  8 and the new capabilities added in Java 9. Topics from Java 8 will include both
  sequential and parallel streams, lambdas, method references, the Optional data type,
  functional interfaces, static and default methods in interfaces, collectors, and
  more. Topics from Java 9 will include the new module system using Jigsaw, the jshell
  REPL, private methods in interfaces, collection factory methods, and additions to
  the Stream, Optional, and CompletableFuture classes.\r\n\r\nThe examples and exercises
  will highlight the ways to write idiomatic Java using the new features. All code
  will be available in a GitHub repository, including Gradle build files and test
  cases. Coding will use the IntelliJ IDEA editor, but Eclipse support will be discussed.\r\n\r\nParticipants
  are expected to be comfortable with, though not necessarily experts using, versions
  of Java prior to Java 8."
