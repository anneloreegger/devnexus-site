title: AI Proof Your Career With Software Architecture
description: "The rapid rise of AI tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, GitHub Copilot, and
  others has many developers worried about their careers, and whether these tools
  will replace programmers. This session will reassure those developers and provide
  some guidance on staying employable in the age of AI.\r\n\r\nWe will begin by looking
  at some areas in software development that are least likely to be impacted by AI,
  such as embedded software, fintech, legal systems,  and avionics, but then we will
  concentrate on software design and architecture.\r\n\r\nYes, you can ask ChatGPT
  to write a REST API in Spring Boot with a JUnit test suite. But can you ask it to
  create an entire enterprise software system? With OpenID security, unit and integration
  tests, a deployment pipeline, management APIs, backup and rollover processes, an
  SLA of less than 100ms while supporting 100K concurrent users, providing localization
  for North American, South American, and European markets, handling PII (personally
  identifiable information), conform to Sarbanes-Oxley standards, and provide documentation?
  No. And probably not for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nWe will look at areas of
  software architecture and design to learn to provide job security. We will see how
  existing AI tools may coexist with human guided software architecture development.
  \r\n\r\nWe will wrap up with a brief look at ArchUnit - a library for testing the
  architecture of a Java application, and how it may be used to guide junior developers
  who use AI tools to generate the \"street level\" code in a project."
