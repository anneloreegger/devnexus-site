title: Wired! How your brain learns new (programming) languages
description: "How much do you know about the computer that you are? The computer we
  call “our brain”? And do you sometimes struggle with learning the new programming
  languages or the features of a new Java version (let’s say Java 17)? Yes?! In that
  case, this talk is something for you!\r\n\r\nIn this talk we’ll look at learning
  a new language from a Linguistic and Neurological perspective, while at the same
  time looking at how we can apply this in the IT setting we work in. At the end of
  this talk you will know how your brain stores new information and how that information
  can be retrieved and used. Next to that you will be given some practical tips and
  tricks on how to improve your own learning curve and how to help others support
  others who are in the process of learning.\r\n\r\nAs a previous speech-and-language
  therapist I would like to give you a better understanding of how we learn languages
  and how this knowledge can help us in the never-ending changing world of software
  development!"
