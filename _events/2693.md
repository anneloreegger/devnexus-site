Oracle offers a steeply discounted rate on certification exams like the OCA and OCP if you take them during the beta period. In this workshop, I’ll be teaching exam topics (including those from Java 9/10/11) and helping attendees get hands on practice with certification type questions and coding. While it isn’t possible to be ready for the test in just a day, we’ll have covered some of the hardest parts and you’ll have a plan to be ready. Even if you don’t intend to take the test, this is an opportunity to get familiar with some of the trickier aspects of some of the new Java features.
