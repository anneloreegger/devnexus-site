title: To Java 22 and Beyond!
description: "Java 21 has come and gone, and the Java release train continues with
  Java 22!\r\n\r\nStill, we will look over the key changes that have come to Java
  in recent releases, briefly discuss what has changed from 11-17, and take time to
  focus on changes in 17+. \r\n\r\nMany key changes have come to Java in recent releases;
  virtual threads, pattern matching, records, Generational ZGC, and more, understanding
  the goals of these changes can be key to understanding where Java is now and where
  it is going in the future!"
