Set against the backdrop of the capabilities of the browser, this interactive session compares and contrasts both approaches through two different applications. In the first, you will learn image processing and feature detection techniques to track, and solve, a Rubikâ€™s Cube. In the second, you will learn to apply those techniques to build an object classifier for facial recognition. Sit in the front row at your own risk!
