title: Just-in-time Compilation Isn’t Magic
description: "Just-in-time Compilation Isn’t Magic\r\n\r\nFortunately for most Java
  developers the just-in-time compiler just works and appears to work by magic.  And
  yet sometimes, we find ourselves facing a performance problem, so what do we when
  the magic stops?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll learn a few key concepts behind the
  magic of modern optimizing compilers: intrinsics, basic blocks, static single assignment,
  and inlining.  By the learning these concepts, you’ll learn to save time not trying
  to optimize the things that the compiler can already do for you and focus on things
  that matter most.\r\n"
