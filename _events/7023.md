The features released between Java 11 and Java 18 have brought many opportunities for developers to improve application development productivity as well as code expressiveness and readability.In this hands-on session, you will discover all the recent Project Amber features added to the Java language such as Records (including Records serialization), Pattern Matching for `instanceof`, switch expression, sealed classes, and hidden classes. You will also have the ability to test some of the newer APIs introduced in the JDK (ex. UDS). In addition, this lab will also touch on some newer tools (ex. jwebserver) and features introduced recently in the JDK (ex. serialization filter).Attend this Hands-on Lab to understand what JDK 18 brings to developers, and make sure to bring your laptop!
