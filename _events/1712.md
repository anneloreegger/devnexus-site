In this one-day workshop you will learn about the new JUnit 5, and also Behavior Driven Development with Spock, and gain experience with several of the core practices that make it so valuable to developers. By the end of the workshop you will have good, working knowledge, of JUnit 5 and BDD, and how it can help you deliver higher quality code in less time.

The difference between JUnit 4 and 5 is far bigger than the difference between 3 and 4. JUnit 5 was released in September so it is high time to learn about next generation JUnit. Come learn about the new features and the new styles of unit testing that JUnit 5 allows.
You'll learn about:
Writing clean code
   Writing good specifications and tests
   User acceptance tests, integration tests, and unit tests
   Pair, and mob, programming
   Life without the debugger
