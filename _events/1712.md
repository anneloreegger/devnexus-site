title: 'Testing  Fundamental Java: Junit 5 and BDD'
abstract: "In this one-day workshop you will learn about the new JUnit 5, and also
  Behavior Driven Development with Spock, and gain experience with several of the
  core practices that make it so valuable to developers. By the end of the workshop
  you will have good, working knowledge, of JUnit 5 and BDD, and how it can help you
  deliver higher quality code in less time.\r\n\r\nThe difference between JUnit 4
  and 5 is far bigger than the difference between 3 and 4. JUnit 5 was released in
  September so it is high time to learn about next generation JUnit. Come learn about
  the new features and the new styles of unit testing that JUnit 5 allows.\r\nYou'll
  learn about:\r\nWriting clean code\r\n   Writing good specifications and tests\r\n
  \  User acceptance tests, integration tests, and unit tests\r\n   Pair, and mob,
  programming\r\n   Life without the debugger\r\n\r\n"
