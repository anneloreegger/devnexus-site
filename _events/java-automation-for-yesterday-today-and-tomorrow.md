title: Java automation for yesterday, today and tomorrow
description: "Consistency, repeatability and simplicity are core tenants to being
  successful in todayâ€™s face paced, highly competitive industry. Infrastructure and
  development teams configuring systems that run Java workloads as well as the workloads
  themselves can achieve these principles through the use of automation.\r\n\r\nAnsible
  Middleware is an Open Source Project that leverages the power of Ansible automation
  to provide solutions for infrastructure teams managing Java based application servers
  and systems as well as integrations for developers running Java frameworks. Concerns
  shared among these groups include Middleware as GitOps, Compliance as Code, the
  underlying infrastructure, the application server configuration, patching, upgrades
  and integration between each of the systems, to name a few.\r\n\r\nRegardless if
  the systems and workloads were developed using legacy components or the next generation
  technologies, utilize a suite of tools that automates your Java based estate. \r\n\r\nIn
  this session, attendees will:\r\n* Learn the importance of automation at scale\r\n*Understand
  the tools and solutions provided by the Ansible Middleware project\r\n* Automate
  Java application servers regardless of their location: on premise, in the cloud,
  or at the edge\r\n* See how easy it is to build and deploy Quarkus based applications
  using automation\r\n* Leverage a suite of assets that development and operations
  teams can leverage in their own environment\r\n"
