title: Reduce System Fragility with Terraform
description: "As infrastructure stacks grow increasingly more complex and involve
  an ever-growing number of services and systems there are a lot of opportunities
  for error and misconfiguration. To provide more system stability teams have looked
  to abstract configuration to its own layer of code. This concept of configuring
  infrastructure as code is gaining traction throughout the industry for a variety
  of reasons. It's fast, consistent, reduces errors, self-documentation, and did I
  mention it's fast? Tools such as Terraform from HashiCorp have emerged as one of
  the leading ways to declaratively configure technology stacks.\r\n\r\nIn this talk
  you'll gain an understanding of the benefits of Infrastructure as Code in general,
  and of using Terraform specifically. You'll be introduced to how Terraform works,
  what the code looks like, and how to get started."
