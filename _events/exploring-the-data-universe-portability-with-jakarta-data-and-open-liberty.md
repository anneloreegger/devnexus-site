title: 'Exploring the Data Universe: Portability with Jakarta Data and Open Liberty'
description: "We live on a data-driven planet where data can be accessed from relational
  databases, non-relational databases, message streams, and more.  Often our enterprise
  Java applications are restricted by the back-end datastore they were written to
  access.  Let us explore a new universe where data is captured, accessed, and persisted
  without such restrictions.\r\n\r\nThe unity and standardization of data access and
  persistence was the catalyst for the Jakarta Data project.  The Jakarta Data specification
  provides a modern persistence model focused on the stable and portable needs of
  the modern enterprise application developer.  Using Jakarta Data on Open Liberty
  offers developers a cloud-native platform to prototype, test, and deploy applications.\r\n\r\nIn
  this session, we will showcase the domain-driven repository pattern of the Jakarta
  Data project to persist data to the relational database.  We will highlight the
  query mechanism to utilize sorting, streaming, and paging.  Once our application
  is written, we will swap out the relational database for a non-relational database
  to highlight just how easy this can now be with Jakarta Data."
