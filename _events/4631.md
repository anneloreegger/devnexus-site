More and more companies are adopting some form of cloud for hosting their applications. Cloud also increasingly means Docker containers and Kubernetes to orchestrate them. Cloud is a different beast when it comes to running Java applications. It focuses on fast provisioning, ephemeral containers that startup and scale quickly and use minimum resources when idle. Correspondingly the JVM has undergone a number of changes that help it to adapt to cloud environments. 

This talk looks closely at each of the cloud specific aspects and explores the changes in Java that a developer needs to be aware of to make the most of running a Java app in the cloud and provides a github based tutorial for reference.
