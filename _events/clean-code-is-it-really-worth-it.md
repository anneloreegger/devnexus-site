title: Clean code, is it really worth it?
description: "As developers, we participate every day in our software life cycle adding
  new logic, adapting the existing one, and integrating with services or platforms.\r\n\r\nBut,
  do we put the same effort into making software robust, maintainable, consistent,
  secure, clear, and tested?\r\n\r\nIn this session, I will show the need for good
  practices in Clean Code along with the issues of not using it, showing concepts
  like Clean As You Code (CAYC) using free and open-source tools.\r\n\r\nClean Code
  goes beyond the produced software and its programming language. Is a fundamental
  part of a developer's role growth, something that represents us no matter the language
  and the company where we work. Do not lose the thread."
