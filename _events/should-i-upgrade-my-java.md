title: Should I upgrade my Java?
description: Java 11 was released in September 2018, and Java 17 was released in 2021.
  However, even today, plenty of developers still use Java 11 or even Java 8. The
  motivation behind this talk is to make a compelling argument for an upgrade from
  Java 8 or 11 to Java 17. In this session, Nikhil will showcase the new features,
  demonstrate improvements, provide performance comparisons, and briefly discuss upgrade
  strategies. At the end, you’ll be able to answer the question, “Should I upgrade
  my Java?”
