Competitive markets dictate an ever-increasing need to be able to react quickly and deliver business value and quality efficiently. Organizations that cannot evolve to the newer and faster-paced delivery models will not survive. DevOps is necessary to build robust software solutions and products quickly and reliably, without increasing risk or sacrificing quality. Today’s leaders need to understand what DevOps is all about and how to implement it across the enterprise to remain competitive and facilitate growth. This session will explain what DevOps is and isn’t, what benefits should we expect adopting it, and what we need to do to move into a DevOps mindset. We’ll look at our current delivery process and discuss how we can deliver higher quality, more secure software, and how we can do it faster, more reliably, and have more confidence in the result. We will focus on the culture and process, only touching on the tools that enable us to work better. It is not a technical deep dive. This session is appropriate for executives and leaders, managers, project managers, and team leads. Participants will take away exercises that are designed to build the insight needed for successful DevOps transformation and leadership.
