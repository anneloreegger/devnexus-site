title: 'Platform Engineering 101: Building Internal Developer Platforms'
description: "Tell us what you want, what you really, really want… Developer productivity
  and reduced cognitive load, of course!\r\n\r\nIn our world of cloud-native Java
  development and shift-left mentality, developers are now drowning! They have an
  endless flood of tasks and responsibilities on their shoulders, whilst battling
  an ever-increasing sea of potential technologies and tools to use. Change is needed!
  So, build a dam with us through platform engineering and IDPs.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop,
  we’ll explore the concepts of platform engineering and Internal Developer Platforms
  (IDPs) and how they can help to relieve the cognitive load on developers, help to
  standardize technologies and tools used throughout an organization, streamline CI/CD
  pipelines and in essence enable greater developer productivity. We’ll investigate
  how this can all be achieved in the cloud, with example applications running in
  OpenShift, with Red Hat Developer Hub as the basis of our IDP. Throughout this workshop,
  you’ll learn how to utilize Red Hat Developer Hub, an implementation of the Backstage
  CNCF project, to create an IDP and then how this can be shared with development
  teams to enable rapid, easy deployment of their applications. We’ll demo this with
  a range of technologies, runtimes and tools to really showcase just how flexible
  and personalised these IDPs can be to your own organization and application needs."
