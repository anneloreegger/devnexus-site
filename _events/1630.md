In this tutorial session, the audience will learn Eclipse Collections by going through the Eclipse Collections Kata. This kata is set up as a series of unit tests which fail. The participants will make them pass using Eclipse Collections. The instructors will discuss the solutions live and explain the concepts behind the iteration patterns in greater detail.

Iteration patterns with Java 8 streams patterns, basic refactoring techniques and memory, performance comparisons will be covered in the tutorial.

Eclipse Collections (formerly known as GS Collections) is an open-source Java collections framework which supplements JDK collections. It was migrated to Eclipse foundation in October 2015. Eclipse collections has both object and primitive containers; rich APIs available for eager and lazy iteration patterns; mutable and immutable collections; and additional container types not available in the JDK, such as Bag and Multimap.
