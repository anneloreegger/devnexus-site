In this session we'll talk about building Java microservices that start in milliseconds and have a low memory footprint, which makes them perfect for cloud deployments. They can be built using GraalVM — a high-performance virtual machine, that can also compile Java applications into native executables.

You’ll learn how to get started, take a look at various frameworks that work with GraalVM native image, and learn about optimizing performance of native images.
