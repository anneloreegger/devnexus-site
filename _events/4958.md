Everyone’s written Java Code, but not everyone has delved into the heart of the JVM. This talk will give you an overview of some of the JVM’s coolest features. Not a Java programmer, don’t worry terms like “compressed oops”, “tiered compilation”, and “dynamic class loading” will both be defined and then their implementation explored. Maybe you’ll find some inspiration for your own language runtime? Have any garbage collection questions?, Parallel, Concurrent, Low Latency, Why do we need so many? All will become clear. We’ll also take a sneak peak at Checkpoint/Restore, my current project which aims at decreasing memory usage and startup time.
