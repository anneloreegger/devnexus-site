Knative extends Kubernetes via Custom Resource Definitions to provide support for higher level developer concerns such as autoscaling and routing across revisions of an application. Knative also provides support for pluggable build strategies and an eventing model for connecting publishers to subscribers. riff is an open source, event-driven, function as a service platform built on top of Knative. In this session, we will take a tour of Knative and riff with demos of the developer experience along the way.
