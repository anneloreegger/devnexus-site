title: Shifting Left with Kubernetes
description: "The Shift Left philosophy is a product of the Agile movement. Its practices
  encourage teams to test and validate software as early in the process as possible.
  It’s been shown that the earlier issues are found and addressed that overall quality,
  time to delivery, and project costs improve. As teams adopt Shift Left, one notable
  exception is often overlooked. That is deployment. Over the past decade, application
  deployment has steadily become more of a software effort. The argument can easily
  be made that validating application deployment, which has primarily become a software
  effort, is just as much a candidate for Shift Left as the application itself. With
  containerization continuing its rise on becoming the application deployment norm,
  the notion of a production-like system deployed as far left in the cycle as a developer’s
  workstation is a practical reality. In organizations that have adopted Kubernetes,
  each phase of the delivery pipeline is able to accurately replicate a production
  environment.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will examine the benefits and challenges
  of Shifting Left by building and validating Kubernetes-based deployments. Topics
  include replicating production environments starting with development workstations,
  strategies for maintaining deployment code alongside application source code, considerations
  for artifact registries and repositories, and tooling that can assist at each stage.\r\n"
