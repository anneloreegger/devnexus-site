You’re in love with Spring Boot, but you miss your old pal AngularJS? Don’t fear, Vue.js is here! Vue is very similar to AngularJS, but much more powerful, yet slim and light for PWAs.

In this session, you’ll see how to build a Spring Boot API and secure it with Spring Security. You’ll also learn how to build a Vue.js PWA, all the while enjoying a bootiful hot-code-reload experience. Lots of live coding in this one!
