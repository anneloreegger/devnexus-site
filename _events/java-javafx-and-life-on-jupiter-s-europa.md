title: Java, JavaFX, and Life on Jupiter’s Europa
description: "NASA’s deep space Clipper mission will launch in 2024 and travel to
  Jupiter’s icy moon Europa searching for the conditions and evidence of organic life.
  The mission’s success hinges on innumerable technical trials, from evaluating spacecraft
  trajectories to prioritizing surface observation targets. To help the Europa Clipper
  team navigate these complex challenges, we developed a Java-based visualization,
  planning, and analysis tool, named Cadmus.\r\n\r\nThe planning and analysis of the
  Europa Clipper mission requires highly precise spatial geometries, as the spacecraft
  will be flying at a speed of kilometers per seconds, while targeting small features
  on the Europa surface. At nearly 1 billion kilometers away from Earth, precision
  in planning is paramount. For this, the Cadmus tool uses a combination of Java spatial
  geometry toolkits and JavaFX to display the precise positions of the spacecraft,
  planets, moons, stars, surface features, flyby paths, and many more. This effect
  must be both high performance and interactive so that scientists and engineers can
  quickly prioritize and plan upcoming observations. \r\n\r\nTo achieve this, we created
  an infrastructure in Java that allows us to responsively render and interact with
  maps and space views by combining JavaFX and AWT in a multi-threaded approach. This
  approach has been extremely successful, and now supports missions outside of Europa
  Clipper, analyzing spacecraft and data around Saturn, Venus, the Moon, and all the
  way back to Earth. This presentation will review the NASA Clipper use case, provide
  a live demo of the software while discussing code segments that are insightful or
  tricky for such an implementation."
