Kotlin is a JVM-based language from JetBrains that works well with Java frameworks like Spring and is the preferred language for Android. According to recent developer surveys, it is among the fastest growing and most desired languages in industry today.

This workshop covers the features of Kotlin from basic topics, like nullability, val and var keywords, and the fundamental data types, to more advanced features like collections, sequences, functional programming, scope functions, and operator overloading. Exercises will include creating Kotlin scripts and classes, when to use top-level functions, working with existing libraries and domain-specific languages, and more.

While Kotlin also provides multi-platform capabilities, this workshop will focus primarily on its relationship and interoperability with Java. No previous knowledge of Kotlin is required. Some familiarity with Java or a similar object-oriented language would be helpful.
