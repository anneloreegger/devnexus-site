Most mission-critical systems have distributed elements or are entirely distributed, resulting in a number of challenges: performance, scalability, reliability, resilience...the eight fallacies of distributed computing are alive and well!

Messaging platforms are often used to solve these problems and increase the "ilities", but they don't come without a few complexities of their own. Come to this session to learn how to leverage open source solutions like Spring Cloud Stream, RabbitMQ, & Apache Kafka to maximize your distributed systems' capabilities while minimizing complexity. All examples will be coded *live & in real-time*!
