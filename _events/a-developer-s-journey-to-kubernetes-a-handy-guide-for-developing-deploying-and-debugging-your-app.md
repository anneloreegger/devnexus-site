title: 'A developer’s journey to Kubernetes: a handy guide for developing, deploying,
  and debugging your app'
description: "Containers are everywhere nowadays, and they have changed the way we
  develop, architect, deploy and troubleshoot our apps in production.\r\n\r\nThis
  talk will cover the most important things you need to know from developing containerized
  apps, to deploying them into your Kubernetes cluster, and finally, debugging them.\r\n\r\nWe
  will cover valuable tools to boost your productivity on Kubernetes—like Skaffold,
  Dart, Buildpacks and Jib—and discuss common deployment patterns and best practices.
  We know developers need to understand how to manage resources, application lifecycle
  and which K8s API objects to use for which component, and in this talk we’ll detail
  these important items. We also know that developers struggle to troubleshoot their
  deployed applications, because, well, things break and you need to figure out why!\r\n"
