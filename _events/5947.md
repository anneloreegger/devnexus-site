The most efficient way to observe application behavior relies on metrics, key/value pairs of numerical data. Capturing and processing metrics can help you identify and respond to potential issues before they escalate and cause more serious problems, but doing that begs a few questions: What data points should you gather? Do custom metrics support SRE? Attendees will leave the talk with an understanding of how application metrics align with monitoring methods in a System Reliability Engineering context.
