title: The Platform Engineer Playbook - 5 Ways to Container Security
description: "The infamous Log4Shell vulnerability took the software community by
  surprise two years ago; it was a perfect storm of the massively popular open-source
  library with a vulnerability that was fairly trivial to attack. Will there be another
  massive vulnerability to deal with this year? It’s always possible, but there are
  things you can do to protect your application.\r\n\r\nAs we address additional layers
  in our defense-in-depth model, and with many containers requiring scale, an advanced
  application network with a wide array of security features is required. How do we
  ensure the right policies are in place to allow communication? What mechanisms exist
  to ensure that payloads in our network cannot be deciphered or replayed? How do
  we leverage identity to attest containers and their intent?\r\n\r\nFrom a developer’s
  shell to a platform engineer moving to a runtime in production, there are many tools
  and practices available to mitigate and detect would-be attackers and make their
  lives harder.\r\n\r\nThis session will include a live demo of the Log4Shell remote
  code exploit (RCE) and effective techniques to defend against vulnerabilities like
  it such as:\r\n- Code & container image scanning\r\n- Best practices for container
  runtime configuration\r\n- Policy enforcement in Kubernetes\r\n- Container authentication
  & authorization\r\n- Encryption & identification for services\r\n\r\nJoin us and
  protect your organization from an attack on the next critical CVE and make it harder
  for attackers to leverage it against you!"
