Learning about design patterns is not really hard. Using design patterns is also not that hard. But, using the right design pattern for the right problem is not that easy. If instead of looking for a pattern to use if we decide to look for the design force behind a problem it may lead to better solutions. Furthermore, with most mainstream languages supporting lambda expressions and functional style, the patterns appear in so many more elegant ways as well.

In this workshop we will start with a quick introduction of a few patterns. Then we will work with multiple examplesâ€”take a problem, delve into the design, and as we solve it, see what patterns emerge in the design. The objective of this workshop is to get a hands on experience to prudently identify and use patterns that help create extensible code.
