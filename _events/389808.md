title: Kontain Your Spring
description: "Although Java originally promised write once, run anywhere, it failed
  to fully deliver on that promise. As developers, we can develop, test, and build
  our applications into WAR or executable JAR files and then toss them over the wall
  to a Java application server and Java runtime that we have no control over, giving
  us zero confidence that the application will behave the same as when we tested it.\r\n\r\nContainers
  fulfill the write-once, run anywhere promise that Java wasn't able to, by packaging
  the runtime and even the operating system along with our application, giving greater
  control and confidence that the application will function the same anywhere it is
  run. Additionally, containers afford several other benefits, including easy scaling,
  efficiency in terms of resource utilization, and security by isolating containers
  from their host system and from other containers.\r\n\r\nWhile deploying Spring
  applications in containers has always been possible, Spring Boot makes it easier
  to containerize our applications and run them in container architectures such as
  Kubernetes. Spring Boot's support for containerization includes two options: Creating
  containers based on buildpacks or using layers as a means of modularizing and reducing
  the size of our application deployments. Moreover, new components in the Spring
  ecosystem can make your Spring applications Kubernetes-savvy so that they can take
  advantage of what a containerized architecture has to offer.\r\n\r\nIn this example-driven
  session, we're going to look at how to create and deploy Spring applications as
  container images and deploy them into a Kubernetes cluster. Along the way, we'll
  also get to know a few of the most useful tools that a Spring developer can employ
  in their development workflow when building containerized Spring applications. We'll
  also see how to apply patterns of Spring Cloud--such as configuration, service discovery,
  and gateways--using native Kubernetes facilities instead of Spring Cloud components.
  And we'll look at how components of the Spring ecosystem can work with your Spring
  applications to enable them to thrive in a Kubernetes cluster.\r\n"
