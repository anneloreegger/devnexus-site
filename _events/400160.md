title: Loom Virtual Threads in the JDK 20
description: The Loom project has been under work for many years, and just delivered
  Virtual Threads as a preview feature in the JDK 19 and JDK 20. We now have a very
  precise idea of what they are and what you can do with them. Our good old Threads,
  created more than 25 years ago, will see a new kind of lightweight threads. This
  presentation shows you that creating a thread is easier and much cheaper, allowing
  the creation of millions of them in a single JVM. These virtual threads can be block
  at almost no cost. These new virtual threads bring with them new notions that will
  be covered in this talk. Loom threads are coming, and they will change the landscape
  of concurrent programming in Java.
