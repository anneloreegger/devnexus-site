title: Introducing Spring AI
description: "By now, you've no doubt noticed that Generative AI is making waves across
  many industries. In between all of the hype and doubt, there are several use cases
  for Generative AI in many software projects. Whether it be as simple as building
  a live chat to help your users or using AI to analyze data and provide recommendations,
  Generative AI is becoming a key piece of software architecture.\r\n\r\nSo how can
  you implement Generative AI in your projects? Let me introduce you to Spring AI.\r\n\r\nFor
  over two decades, the Spring Framework and its immense portfolio of projects has
  been making complex problems easy for Java developers. And now with the new Spring
  AI project, adding Generative AI to your Spring Boot projects couldn't be easier!
  Spring AI brings an AI client and templated prompting that handles all of the ceremony
  necessary to communicate with common AI APIs (such as OpenAI and Azure OpenAI).
  And with Spring Boot auto-configuration, you'll be able to get straight to the point
  of asking questions and getting answers your application needs.\r\n\r\nIn this session,
  we'll consider a handful of use cases for Generative AI and see how to implement
  them with Spring AI. We'll start simple, then build up to some more advanced uses
  of Spring AI that employ your application's own data when generating answers."
