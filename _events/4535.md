So, you've read the books and articles about clean, hexagonal architecture. And then you look at your current projects and you feel like it's light-years away from that ideal situation. How do you apply those patterns and principles yourself?

In this hands-on lab, we'll take you on a journey to do that! We'll use the Java Module System to help you write clean, well-separated modules. We'll see how we can make this dream a reality. Java has got all we need, so let's get going!
