title: Developer To Architect - Full day workshop
abstract: "Becoming a software architect is a longed-for career upgrade for many software
  developers. While the job title suggests a work day focused on technical decision-making,
  the reality is quite different. In this workshop, software architect Nathaniel Schutta
  constructs a real world job description in which communication trumps coding.\r\n\r\nDiscover
  the skill sets needed to juggle multiple priorities, meetings, and time demands.\r\nLearn
  why your best team leadership tool is not a hammer, but a shared cup of coffee.\r\nHear
  the best ways to give and take criticism.\r\nUnderstand the necessity of writing
  effective email and formal architecture documents.\r\nGet tips for delivering confident
  career-building presentations to any audience.\r\nReview essential techniques for
  stakeholder management and relationship building.\r\nExplore the critical needs for
  architecture reviews and an effective process for conducting them.\r\nThrough lecture
  and small group exercises, Nathaniel will help you understand what it means to be
  a successful architect. Working through various problems, attendees will have opportunities
  to think through architectural decisions and patterns, discuss the importance of
  non functional requirements and why architects cannot afford to practice resume
  driven design."
