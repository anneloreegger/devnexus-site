title: 'Quarkus 3: The Road to Virtual Threads for Cheaper, Faster, and Easier Concurrent
  Applications'
description: Developers have had extraordinary experiences and taken stunning capabilities
  while they were developing Java microservices from local to the cloud using Quarkus
  for the past 5 years. But there is more to come with their journey since we have
  just arrived in Quarkus 3 which provides good, better, and even excellent features
  and capabilities in terms of developer experience, performance, scalability, and
  cloud integration. Especially, Quarkus 3 on Java 21 simplifies asynchronous concurrent
  applications using virtual threads (Project Loom) for high scalability. In this
  session, we take you through how Quarkus integrates Loom on Java 21 for developers
  to make concurrent applications easier, have cheaper memory, and have high performance
  using virtual threads. You can also learn about whatâ€™s new in Quarkus 3 such as
  JakartaEE 10, MicroProfile 6, Hibernate ORM 6, and more.
