title: Jakarta EE for Spring Developers
description: "**Jakarta EE 9** changed its package namespace from `javax.*` to `jakarta.*`.
  This may sound like a trivial change that mostly affects Jakarta EE. So, why should
  Spring developers care?\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, the namespace changes ripple throughout
  the entire Java ecosystem. And Spring is no exception. Spring Framework 6 and Spring
  Boot 3 raise their baseline to Jakarta EE 9 API level which is supported by Tomcat
  10 and Jetty 11 for example.\r\n\r\nAttending this session will teach you how to
  make this migration as smoothly as possible. A live coding demo will take you through
  the steps involved, and point out where to pay special attention.\r\n\r\nWe will
  also briefly examine some of the changes introduced in **Jakarta EE 10** that will
  prepare you for what to expect from Spring 6.x. Some pointers to what we can expect
  from **Jakarta EE 11** will also be given."
