title: Secrets of Performance Tuning Java on Kubernetes
description: Initially, getting Java to run on Kubernetes may seem complicated, but
  after a few lines of YAML and a bit of work with Docker, you will wonder what all
  that fuss was. It is easy! Then you start looking at the performance of your Java
  app in one core, one GB of memory container, and this is when it all very quickly
  gets murky. Ops, SREs, and Java developers need to be aware of the JVM's inner works
  when deciding on how to resource their applications. Without this knowledge, it
  isn't easy to know whether it is best to scale vertically or horizontally for performance
  and costs. This talk will explore JVM ergonomics, CPU throttling, Garbage Collectors,
  and how using this knowledge can help you increase performance while reducing costs
  in the cloud.
