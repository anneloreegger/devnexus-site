title: The Right Number of Partitions for a Kafka Topic
description: "Every technology has that key concept that people struggle to understand.
  With databases, is which join clause to use for fetching data from multiple tables.
  Containers are tricky when you have to pick a storage type given some persistence
  requirements. With Apache Kafka, the winner is how many partitions to set for a
  topic.\r\n\r\nWhy this is important? You may ask. Well, sizing Kafka partitions
  wrongly affects many aspects of the system, such as storage, parallelism, and durability.
  Worse, it may also affect how much load Kafka can handle. Hence why often the decision
  about how many partitions to set for a topic is handled by Ops teams, as we see
  this to be only an infrastructure matter. In reality, this is an architectural design
  decision that affects even the amount of code you write.\r\n\r\nThis session will
  peel off the concept of partitions and explain it from the perspective of the Kafka
  cluster and its clients. It will explain the formula people should use to decide
  how many partitions to set for a topic, and how to spot a poor decision when they
  see one."
