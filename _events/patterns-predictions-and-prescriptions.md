title: Patterns, Predictions, and Programming
description: "\"One of the most interesting aspects of the world is that it can be
  considered to be made up of patterns\"  -  Norbert Wiener (1940s)\r\n\r\nWe are
  entering a new and long-tail phase of software development with Machine Learning
  (ML).  ML, a subset of AI, is the ability of a machine to produce accurate results
  for a particular problem without any explicit programming.  These predictive results
  are derived from recognizing patterns in large data sets.  \r\n\r\nWe are effectively
  giving machines the ability to gain experience.\r\n\r\nThis megatrend affects our
  applications, software tools, data structures, systems architecture, new hardware
  approaches, business processes, organizational interactions, enterprise strategies,
  government behavior, geopolitical strengths, ethics, data privacy, etc.  In essence,
  ML is an inflection point for computing, enterprises, countries, humanity, and civilization.\r\n\r\nWeâ€™ll
  explore some basic ML use cases, take a look at JSR #381 (Visual Recognition for
  Java), and then dive into issues, strategies, and the near-term and long-term directions
  of ML."
