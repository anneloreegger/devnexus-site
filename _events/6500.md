Recently, the Dapr turned 1 year old: one year of helping developers to simplify cloud-native application development. Dapr lets you abstract your distributed architecture from the underlying infrastructure that powers it. Forget about Kafka, RabbitMQ or any cloud-specific product: you're talking with a pub/sub broker. Let Dapr take care of how it works. Want to switch later? Sure, no problem!

So, is Dapr the new J2EE application server? How could it change the way we develop distributed solutions? Join me in this talk to find out if we're looking at a dinosaur in a fancy suit, or a developer's dream.
