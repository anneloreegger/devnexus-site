In this session we will dive deeper into Dockerfiles. We will explore the DSL that Dockerfiles provide to allow for the automation of image creation.

Dockerfiles provide a means to automate the creation of images, and consequently the containers within which our applications run. The Dockerfile, though minimal, provides us with everything we need to package our software, and enable it to run. In this session we will dive deep into the Docker DSL, and explore the many commands that it provides, and along the way explore some differences between similar commands, and some gotchas.
