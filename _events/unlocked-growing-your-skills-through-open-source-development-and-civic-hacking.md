title: 'Unlocked : Growing Your Skills Through Open Source Development And Civic Hacking'
description: "As a developer, we want to increase our knowledge of the development
  world around us so that we can help grow our careers or help the world.   Many folks
  can grow their career through reading blogs, books, following tutorials or watching
  videos. But some of us need a project or community to help us attain our career
  growth. Where can we find these projects or the community? In this discussion, we
  will show you 2 paths that you can take advantage of, so that you can give to the
  community and grow your career. \r\nThe first path that we will discuss is how to
  contribute to an open-source project. This includes the who, what, and how of open
  source and the places where you can contribute to an open source.   Spoilers: Anyone
  can contribute, and you need not be a coder to contribute. \r\nThe second path we'll
  discuss is Civic Hacking. We will define what it is, where to get involved and cover
  its basic tenets:\r\n- Do what you can?\r\n- Where you can?\r\n- With what you've
  got?\r\n"
