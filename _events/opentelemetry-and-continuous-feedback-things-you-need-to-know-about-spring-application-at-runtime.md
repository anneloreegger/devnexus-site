title: OpenTelemetry and Continuous Feedback - Things you need to know about Spring
  application at runtime
description: "What do you know about the code changes that were just introduced into
  the codebase? When will you start noticing if something goes wrong? If there are
  so many accessible observability sources that can tell us what the code is doing,
  why are we using so little of that in our day-to-day coding?\r\n\r\nContinuous Feedback
  is a new dev practice that aims to make practical usage of code runtime data to
  shorten the feedback loop during development. It enables developers to get early
  data about their code changes and detect issues and regressions as-they-code. At
  the same time, collecting data from multiple environments, allows developers to
  instantly understand how their code is performing in the real world.\r\n\r\nIn this
  session, we'll look past the novelty of using OSS observability tools and technologies,
  to discuss how we can actually make them useful for developers. We'll take a look
  at the benefits of enabling OpenTelemetry collection for dev and test data and examine
  OSS tools to help analyze the application runtime. Throughout the talk, we'll go
  over code examples of common anti-patterns, code smells, hidden errors, and other
  types of problems that observability can reveal - prior to merging a PR,\r\n\r\nUltimately,
  the goal should not be simply observing the application or creating nice-looking
  dashboards. Rather, success is in leveraging observability data in order to achieve
  a more effective dev process and write better code."
