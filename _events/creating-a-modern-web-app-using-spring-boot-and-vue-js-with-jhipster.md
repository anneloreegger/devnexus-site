title: Creating a Modern Web App Using Spring Boot and Vue.js with JHipster
description: 'In this talk, I will demonstrate how JHipster can be used to generate
  in few minutes a modern Web app that uses Spring Boot and Vue.js. JHipster will
  provide everything you need to start a complete modern Web app and take it to production
  in a very short amount of time. On top of that, the back-end is built as a high-performance
  and robust Java stack with Spring Boot. More details can be found here: https://www.jhipster.tech/.'
