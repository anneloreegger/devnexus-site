title: Building 10x Organizations with Internal Developer Portals
description: "Developer Experience is Dead! Long Live Developer Experience!\r\n\r\nIn
  this keynote style session, we’ll take a detailed, granular look at the barriers
  to productivity faced by developers today. 10x developers may be a myth, but 10x
  organizations are very real, as proven by the influential study performed in the
  1980s, ‘The Coding War Games.’\r\n\r\nRight now, here in early 2024, we seem to
  be experiencing YAPP (Yet Another Productivity Philosophy), and that philosophy
  is converging on developer experience or ‘DevEx.’ It seems that with every new method
  we invent for the delivery of products, whether physical or virtual, we reinvent
  productivity productivity philosophies to go alongside them.\r\n\r\nWe have no need
  to reinvent another productivity approach when effective solutions such as internal
  developer portals already exist. As business leaders, we just need to invest in
  and create urgency behind these solutions today, so that we don’t find ourselves
  having the same discussion again in a decade.\r\n"
