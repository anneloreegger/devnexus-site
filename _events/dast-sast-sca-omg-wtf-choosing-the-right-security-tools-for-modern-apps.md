title: DAST, SAST, SCA … OMG. WTF?! Choosing the Right Security Tools for Modern Apps
description: "The word “security” can be a scary one for us DevOps folks. We want
  to move fast but no one wants to CI/CD security breaches into production. Security
  remains hard and it’s often really difficult to know how to get started.\r\n\r\nWhat
  tools do we really need to use to test the security of modern web apps?\r\nHow do
  we choose between the alphabet soup of DAST, IAST, RASP, SAST, SCA, etc?\r\nWhat
  value do each of these give us and when should we use them? (Or even not use them…)\r\n\r\nIn
  this talk Simon, creator and core maintainer of OWASP ZAP, will explain the differences
  (and similarities) between the different types of tools available, when we should
  introduce them into our development lifecycle and the challenges that we are likely
  to face in using them with modern web apps.\r\nHe will also talk about specific
  open source tools which can provide real value in this space.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
