title: Tech Parents Do's and Don'ts for Teaching Your Kids Programming (from the perspective
  of a kid)
description: "I have been teaching workshops for underprivileged kids since I was
  13 years old, because I want programming to be fun and engaging just like how I
  learned to program. Teaching kids programming at a young age is really important
  to improve diversity in the field of computer science. Studies show that after middle
  school most students have already made up their mind about a career in computers,
  so having a positive introduction to computers at a young age is really important.\r\n\r\nI
  will share some of the techniques I use to get kids excited about technology, which
  you can use to teach your own kids or others. We will use Phippy and Friends characters
  to introduce basic programming and cloud-computing concepts in a way that is approachable
  for kids of all ages."
