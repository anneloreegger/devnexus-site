title: 'JVM Ergonomics Profiles: Enhancing Resource Consumption and Performance in
  Dedicated Environments'
description: 'Ergonomics Profiles is a new Java Virtual Machine (JVM) feature proposal
  aimed at improving resource utilization and performance in dedicated JVM environments,
  such as containers. The proposal outlines the motivation behind Ergonomics Profiles,
  highlighting the prevalent usage of dedicated resources in modern cloud-based JVM
  workloads. It addresses the limitations of default JVM ergonomics designed for shared
  environments and the resulting resource waste. The proposed solution includes the
  introduction of two profiles: "shared" for traditional environments and "dedicated"
  for systems with dedicated resources. The dedicated profile offers optimized heuristics
  for maximizing resource consumption, including dynamic heap size allocation, enhanced
  garbage collector selection, and native memory estimation. The proposal also presents
  a new flag for profile selection and provides APIs for programmatically identifying
  the selected profile. By incorporating Ergonomics Profiles, JVMs can better adapt
  to dedicated environments, reduce resource waste, and increase overall chances of
  better performance, resulting in more efficient and scalable Java applications.'
