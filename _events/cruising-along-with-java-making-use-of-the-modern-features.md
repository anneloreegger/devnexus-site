title: 'Cruising Along with Java: Making use of the Modern Features'
description: Java was once a language that dragged along at snail's pace. Thankfully,
  that's no longer the case. In the recent years the pace of development has accelerated,
  both in language features and in the JDK improvements. Come along to dive into some
  of the recent changes of Java that are both fun and powerful to use, to learn how
  you can benefit from these, and we'll also discuss where the language is heading
  in the near future.
