title: ML in Java, YES it's possible!
description: "When you think about building and/or deploying machine learning models,
  Java is not within the top 3 languages that we generally think of. Nonetheless Java
  has a strong community, with millions of developers using it as their main language.\r\nWith
  the AI buzz spiking in the past month, All developers, and especially Java developers,
  need to understand how to build and run apps that use ML. In this session we are
  going to explore what are our options, as java developers, to build, save and run
  machine learning models.We are also going to discuss and compare the most 3 popular
  frameworks (Deeplearning4J, djl and Tribuo), along with a real world example to
  understand capabilities and tradeoffs of each framework. We will also briefly cover
  JSR381, an open-source, Java-friendly API for ML, specifically visual recognition"
