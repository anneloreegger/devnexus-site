With the introduction of GitOps workflows into your infrastructure, spinning up exact copies of your application in multiple regions is as easy as git commit and git push. Learn how to extend your GitOps workflow to include policy-as-code and security policies and decisions for these applications can be just as easy. By using Open Policy Agent and Rego to write the policies and security for your application, you can have the same benefits of GitOps for your security policies.
