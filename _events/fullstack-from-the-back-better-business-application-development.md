title: Fullstack from the back! Better business application development
description: "This session will guide attendees through building data-rich business
  applications in an efficient way through the use of Hilla and Flow, two web frameworks
  written by the company, Vaadin. Flow Vaadin Flow is a unique full-stack framework
  that lets you build web apps without writing HTML or JavaScript. You compose the
  UI from components, connect it to a data source and react to user events. The UI
  runs on the JVM without the need to expose REST services or come up with other ways
  to move data to the browser.\r\nThe other framework, Hilla, is an open source framework
  that integrates a Spring Boot Java backend with a reactive TypeScript frontend.
  It works with React or Lit and helps you build business apps faster with type-safe
  server communication, included UI components, and integrated tooling."
