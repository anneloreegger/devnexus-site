title: Fundamentals of Migration Engineering with OpenRewrite
description: "How adaptable is your technology stack to changes in business requirements,
  technological advancements, and the availability of new and better tools (and avoiding
  vendor lock-in!)?\r\n\r\nWhen you can more easily secure, upgrade, move, or modernize
  your code, that means you can adapt quickly and efficiently to changes in technology
  and markets. That’s what Migration Engineering is all about, which we’ll be exploring
  in this workshop.\r\n\r\nWe’ll discuss and demonstrate how to write custom recipes
  using OpenRewrite, an open source auto-refactoring tool, to study and analyze your
  code before planning migration and modernization efforts—and then automate code
  changes for your teams. \r\n\r\nYou’ll also learn how to write recipes that will
  automate code search and transformation actions that are custom to your organization.
  We will assemble these recipes with the visitor pattern, show how to stitch recipes
  together with YAML, with Refaster-style templates, with Semgrep matchers, etc. \r\n\r\nThis
  is a comprehensive look at all kinds of recipe development. You will come away fully
  equipped to plan and exercise large scale code transformations in your organization.\r\n"
