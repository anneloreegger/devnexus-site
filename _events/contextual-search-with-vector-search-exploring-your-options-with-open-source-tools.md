title: 'Contextual search with vector search: exploring your options with open source
  tools.'
description: "Have you noticed the recent improvement in how our searches have become
  smarter? It's fascinating how vector search technology has enhanced our contextual
  search experience.\r\n\r\nThe underlying idea is quite straightforward. For example,
  let's consider an example of a movie recommendation system. The idea is to represent
  each movie in our catalog as a vector, a numerical representation of a piece of
  text.\r\n\r\nOnce we're done with that and also converted the search phrase into
  a vector, we step into a whole new realm — a multidimensional space where these
  vectors replace the original text values. Through some mathematical techniques,
  we can determine which movie representations are closest to the vector representing
  our search query!\r\n\r\nHow do we create such vector representations? We need an
  AI model trained on vast amounts of data to recognize patterns and effectively convert
  text phrases into vectors. \r\n\r\nAll of this you’ll learn in this session. We'll
  try out different data solutions - ClickHouse, OpenSearch and PGVector. We'll also
  explore different models available depending on your language preference and skills,
  or, in case you 'd rather not run the model locally, what APIs you can use to do
  data inference for free.\r\n\r\nPlenty of demos and a bit of coding for each of
  the options. This session will be useful for anyone who is intrigued by contextual
  search and usage of AI, but might find themselves overwhelmed by the complexities
  to get started.\r\n"
