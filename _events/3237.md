It is our experience that 60-70% of all the applications we analyze incur a performance penalty due to how it consumes and/or retains memory. Yet if you ask people what is their biggest performance headache it’s unlikely that they’d recognize memory as being #1. I have been involved in analyzing numerous applications for just these kinds of issues and in this session, I will cover the tell tale signs and symptoms that your application is one of those suffering from some sort of memory issue.  I'll discuss what steps you can take to cure this problem and will also cover how the JVM can both help reduce the memory ~strength of your application.  What should you do?"
