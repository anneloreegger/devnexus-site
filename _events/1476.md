You’ve been comfortable building back-end services in Java or using a Java web framework, but now you must build an application using a JavaScript framework like Angular, React, Polymer, Ember, Backbone, or a home-grown mismatch of jQuery and custom code. Suddenly you have entered an alternative universe with foreign terms like “bower”, “node”, “npm”, “webpack”, “AMD”,  “CommonJS”, “ES6”, “ES2015”, “TypeScript”, “Babel”, “gulp”, “grunt”, “shim”, “polyfill”, and more. What do they all mean, and how are they related to each other? More importantly, how do they compare to what we know and love in the Java universe? Join us as we explore another universe.
