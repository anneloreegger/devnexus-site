title: Going from containers, to pods, to Kubernetes – help for your developer environments!
description: Today, Kubernetes is the undisputed go-to platform for scaling containers.
  But for developers, Kubernetes can be daunting, particularly when working with the
  discrepancies between local and production environments. Podman and Podman Desktop
  bridges this gap. In this talk, you’ll be introduced to Podman and witness the unveiling
  of Podman Desktop, an open-source GUI tool that streamlines container workflows
  and is compatible with Podman, Lima, Docker, and more. Podman Desktop serves as
  a beginner-friendly launch pad to Kubernetes, enabling developers to spin up local
  clusters (with Kind and Minikube) or work with remote environments. A demo will
  be given that helps you navigate the paths necessary to transition from app to containers,
  to pods, and ultimately to Kubernetes, highlighting how it reduces discrepancies
  and enables predictability in your deployments by leveraging Podman and Podman Desktop's
  perks and security advantages. You'll also learn how you can benefit from Podman
  Desktop to streamline your container development processes!
