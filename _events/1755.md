Micro services have been the fad du-jour for several years on the server-side, and now micro SPAs (Single-Page Applications) are coming into the limelight bringing the same concepts to the front end stack. My team has spent the last couple of years experimenting with micro SPAs, and I will be sharing our experiences so far in this presentation. We will cover some basics of why one may choose a micro SPA architecture over traditional monoliths, some things we have loved about this design pattern, as well as problems to solve. Additionally, we will discuss some of the nuts and bolts of our approach to implementing this design pattern. Those attending should expect to get a good idea of the overarching idea of micro SPA architecture as well as some implementable direction to get started on them yourself.
