The Tekton open source project is a Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery pipeline technology built on Kubernetes.  It enables you to build a flexible delivery validation and delivery pipeline while taking advantage of a scalable and container-based cluster manager.  This talk will introduce you to Tekton and help you learn its different components.  Through live demos you will learn how to setup your own Kubernetes-based CI/CD pipeline with Tekton.
