title: Event sourcing - the good parts
description: "Event sourcing can be very appealing for the auditability and replay
  capabilities it provides. However, when used without care, it can paralyze application
  development, especially after the original team members move on to other things
  and are replaced by new team members that were not there when history was written.
  \ \r\n\r\nHow can we make efficient use of this pattern to leverage its benefits
  without being slowed down by the drawbacks? In this talk we will present our experience
  using it to develop trading engines at the Intercontinental Exchange, and the tradeoffs
  we made to keep it from slowing us down. "
