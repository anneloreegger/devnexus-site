title: 'Best of Both Worlds: Apache Pulsar and Apache Kafka'
description: "Which streaming technology is right for me? Do I need to use Apache
  Pulsar or do I choose  Apache Kafka?\r\n\r\nThat is mostly the question, but did
  you also knew that you can combine them? \r\n\r\nIn this session we will show how
  to use best of both worlds. Let's compare both architectures and Java Client Implementations
  and decide what's best for you!\r\n\r\nDo you pick the battle? Or are you making
  allies?\r\nIt's up to you!"
