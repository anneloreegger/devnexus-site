Spring Framework and Spring Boot made huge strides to make it easier than ever to develop the next generation of cloud native applications. More importantly, a number of Spring projects provides cloud-vendor agnostic abstractions to developers, so that with a simple configuration switch, you are able to move your local application to run in an on-prem datacenter, or in the cloud with managed services.

Google and Pivotal partnered to develop Spring Cloud adapters for Google Cloud Platform. With Spring Cloud GCP, you can quickly develop cloud native applications & harness the power of Google infrastructure, including easy connection to GCP's managed databases, using Pub/Sub to send and receive messages, and other tools for tracing and monitoring your services.

In this session, we'll build cloud native service with Spring Boot that:
Takes advantage of Google Cloud Platform highly available managed services, such as Cloud SQL, Pub/Sub, Cloud Spanner.
Deploys to managed environments, such as Kubernetes, App Engine, and Cloud Run.
Operate the application by using monitoring, tracing, centralized logging, debugging, and profiling tools.

Prereqs: A laptop with a Chrome browser.
