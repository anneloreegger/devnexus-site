Everybody agrees that programming languages are lightning-fast and powerful. Yet performance quickly hits a bottleneck when a database is part of the stack. For years and years, databases have been seen as the slow, monolithic back ends that limit your application's throughput. Yet the reality is that most of the time, it is the code interacting with the database that limits your throughput. Autocommit, too many network round-trips, doing unnecessary work are just some of the culprits that will limit your throughput. Yet all of those can easily be avoided with some simple tricks and refactoring of your code. In this session, learn how to apply tricks that will supercharge your application. Never wait for a reply from your DBA again.
