title: Optimize your applications to the max with Jakarta EE and MicroProfile
description: "When using complementary tools for optimal utilization in containers
  and scalable infrastructures, you can achieve optimal value when developing and
  running enterprise software. Jakarta EEâ€™s mechanics and application server runtimes
  are perfect tools for achieving this goal, especially when complemented with MicroProfile.
  This applies whether you are building monoliths, microservices, or anything in between.\r\n\r\nAttendees
  will learn how to optimally build, run and deploy such enterprise applications.
  Therefore, the session will show little application code, but focus on the concepts,
  tools, and configurations that are applicable. I will also compare some key concepts
  with competitors like Spring Framework to emphasize the benefits and downsides."
