title: Unveiling the Magical Power of Java Virtual Threads
description: "Thread-per-request programming limits application scalability, leading
  developers to adopt thread sharing and asynchronous programming to better utilize
  hardware, though this introduces additional complexity. Creating reactive pipelines,
  debugging them, and visualizing their execution can be complicated tasks, compounded
  by the complexities that arise when exceptions occur.\r\nJava Virtual Threads enable
  applications to scale while preserving the thread-per-request style programming.
  Just as operating systems create the illusion of abundant memory by mapping a large
  virtual address space to limited physical RAM, a Java runtime can create the illusion
  of many threads by mapping numerous virtual threads to a few OS threads.\r\nLet's
  explore Java virtual threads, including how they work under the hood, their use
  cases, and the APIs introduced by Project Loom. We'll also compare traditional threads
  with virtual threads through a simple programming example to see their benefits
  in action."
