title: 'Your Java Code in the Kubernetes Native Era: A Live Coding Experience'
description: "Is your Java code ready for the Kubernetes Native era?\r\n\r\nThere's
  a lot of hype around this topic. However, modern applications do indeed come with
  complexities like scalability, containerization, and service mesh, which Kubernetes
  can undoubtedly address.\r\n\r\nThe question is: Is your Java code ready for all
  of this? If you make the right choices, the answer is yes!\r\n\r\nQuarkus has been
  built with a Kubernetes Native approach, and it even allows you to use MicroProfile,
  Camel, Hibernate, and various other open-source projects among the world's best.\r\n\r\nNow
  is the time to embrace Kubernetes with Java! And this 100% practical session will
  show you how to do it today."
