Thereâ€™s no better way to understand container security than seeing some live hacking! This session introduces the state of docker security by reviewing vulnerabilities in docker images and their impact on applications, and demonstrates via hands-on live hacking. This session further provides the audience with security best practices when building docker container images, and each successful hack will help you better understand the mistakes you can make, their implications, and how you can avoid them.
