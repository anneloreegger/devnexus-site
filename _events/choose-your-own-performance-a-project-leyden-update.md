title: Choose Your Own Performance; a Project Leyden Update!
description: Project Leyden allows developers to selectively improve startup time,
  time to peak performance, and the footprint of Java programs, by doubling down on
  Java's super power of speculative optimization using capabilities built directly
  into the JDK. See how speculative optimizations allow AOT (ahead-of-time compilation)Â code
  to make tradeoffs between Java's static and dynamic nature as well as how new tools
  like Condensers and ComputedConstants may play role in further improvements.
