title: Your Cloud-Native Toolbox for Java
description: "What does it mean to have cloud-native Java applications? What do you
  need to think about to be a good Cloud citizen?\r\n\r\nIt is not about the platform
  you run it on or the library/framework you want to use. It is about how you build
  scalable, observable, resilient applications while keeping in mind the application
  architecture, containers, builds, testing, automation, and standards.\r\n\r\nJoin
  us in exploring different tools for creating cloud-native Java apps. We will go
  through the whole life-cycle of an application â€“ from the first lines of code to
  a fully operational and containerized application."
