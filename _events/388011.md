title: From Monolith to (Âµ)Services. What happens with my Data?
description: "Rewriting systems from a monolithic architecture to a services architecture
  is a common task nowadays to make applications easier to maintain, deploy, and release.
  This migration should not be a big bang rewrite where you directly switch from the
  old application to the new one. Instead, it is an incremental process during which
  functionalities are extracted one at a time into separate services.\r\n \r\nThe
  Strangler Fig Pattern describes a method whereby a new system is slowly and incrementally
  growing over the top of an old system. Along the way, the whole system is continuously
  monitored such that old parts can be removed after the new services show correct
  behavior. The theory is pretty clear, and in services where no persistence is needed,
  it's considerably easier, but things become way more complex as soon as data is
  involved.\r\n \r\nCome to this session to learn how Kafka and Debezium, through
  Change Data Capture and the Strangler Fig pattern, can help you migrate from monoliths
  to a (micro)services architecture confidently even though databases are involved.\r\n"
