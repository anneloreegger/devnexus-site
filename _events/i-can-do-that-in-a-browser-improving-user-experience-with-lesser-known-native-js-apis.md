title: I Can Do THAT in a Browser? Improving User Experience with Lesser Known Native
  JS APIs
description: 'Did you know that you can access your user''s geolocation coordinates
  via JavaScript? What about accessing a device''s battery status, orientation, accelerometer,
  and gyroscope? Or connecting to a Bluetooth device. How about pulling data from
  an external device via a Serial or WebUSB? Are you aware of the Fullscreen  or the
  GamePad API? Have an e-commerce app or an app that processes microtransactions?
  Does it use the PaymentRequest API? There are tons of really cool APIs that you
  might not be aware of. Or maybe you are aware of them, but you''re just not sure
  how to use them to improve your application? In this session, I''ll introduce you
  to some of the lesser known APIs that are available in most modern web browsers.
  I''ll also show you some demos that I''ve created with these APIs to show you how
  they can actually be used to make engaging experiences that keep your users happy
  and keep them coming back to your site. '
