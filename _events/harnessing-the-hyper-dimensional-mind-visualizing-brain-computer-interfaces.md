title: 'Harnessing the Hyper-dimensional Mind: Visualizing Brain Computer Interfaces'
description: "The future of human machine teaming will harness the human mind in ways
  that were the dreams of the past's science fiction. The technology is here now but
  researchers are challenged to understand the incredible complexity of the human
  brain.\r\n\r\nFunctional brain computer interfaces are a now a nascent but rapidly
  accelerating field. With the physical technology becoming a reality governments,
  corporations and research facilities are racing to find ways to understand how the
  human mind can be harnessed for good.\r\n\r\nOne of the many challenges of Brain
  Computer Interfaces is decoding and interpreting the hyper-dimensional signals that
  come from a human brain's connected neurons. A critical method for understanding
  this decoding is visualization.\r\n\r\nThis keynote discussion will describe what
  makes a brain computer interface possible, how it can be utilized and what the current
  limitations are. A software demonstration will be provided which demonstrates receiving,
  organizing and visualizing decoded neuron data with dimensions well beyond 3D.  Animated
  visualizations will be provided which provide insight into the brain's actions and
  how such a technology could be used for good and the betterment of mankind in the
  future. "
