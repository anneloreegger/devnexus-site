title: 'Calculating the Value of Pie: Real-Time Survey Analysis With Apache Kafka®'
description: "These days, it’s difficult to keep up with friends and family, even
  more so when important things are involved––like pie. Do you find yourself wishing
  that you could quickly and efficiently poll your loved ones, peers, and colleagues
  for their pastry preferences? Look no further. This talk explores how to create
  an interactive, real-time survey bot with Telegram and Apache Kafka® and how to
  analyze the survey responses using ksqlDB.\r\n\r\nKafka Producers and Consumers
  are the main ingredients that come together to make an interactive Telegram bot
  that issues on-demand surveys to friends and family. Survey responses are written
  to Kafka in real-time where ksqlDB helps to measure, mix, and knead the data––serving
  up a fresh and delicious result that we can consume immediately! In this session,
  you’ll see the entire pipeline from start to finish, learning how to think about
  data and use schemas, how to configure Producers and Consumers, and how to use ksqlDB
  for both stateless and stateful processing. \r\n\r\nCome along to see how this recipe
  for real-time survey analysis comes together––and how you, too, can calculate the
  value of pie!"
