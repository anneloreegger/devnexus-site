title: Trash Talk - Exploring the memory management in the JVM
description: In the realm of Java programming, understanding memory management and
  garbage collection mechanisms cannot only be helpful for optimizing performance
  and resource utilization but also in general will help you to use the right garbage
  collector for your application. This session will be about memory allocation, object
  lifecycle, and garbage collection strategies within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
  Attendees will gain insights into memory allocation strategies, object retention
  policies, and various garbage collection algorithms like generational and concurrent
  collection. So when you are interested in getting more knowledge about which garbage
  collector to use best for your application or about memory management in the JVM,
  this session is for you.
