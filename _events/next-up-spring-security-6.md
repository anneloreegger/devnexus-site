title: 'Next up: Spring Security 6'
description: "Holy deprecations, Batman!\r\n\r\nAside from all the great native, observability,
  and authorization features, SAML and OAuth enhancements, and password security improvements,
  the Spring Security team did a lot of clean-up, too!\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll
  start with a secured Spring Security 5.8 app, prepare it for 6.0, update, and then
  add features like crazy. :) We may even get to use Spring Authorization Server 1.0
  in the process."
