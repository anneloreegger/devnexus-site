title: JSON Data Modeling in Document Databases
description: If you’re thinking about using a document database, it can be intimidating
  to start. A flexible data model gives you a lot of choices, but which way is the
  right way? Is a document database even the right tool? In this session we’ll go
  over the basics of data modeling using JSON. We’ll compare and contrast with traditional
  RDBMS modeling. Impact on application code will be discussed, as well as some tooling
  that could be helpful along the way. The examples use the free, open-source Couchbase
  Server document database, but the principles from this session can also be applied
  to CosmosDb, Mongo, RavenDb, etc.
