title: Observability For Java Devs - 2023 Edition
description: "As applications move to containers and migrate to the cloud, they become
  ever more complex, and it's increasingly important to monitor, analyze, and diagnose
  their behaviour. Observability is a new way of thinking about monitoring and understanding
  your applications. Itâ€™s supported by a growing range of open source tools and standards
  - part of the new wave of technologies that modern developers need to go fully Cloud
  Native.\r\n\r\nJoin Ben Evans to get the state of the fundamentals of Observability
  in 2023. You'll learn how to achieve observability in Java using OpenTelemetry,
  the emerging Open Standard for Observability, and we'll meet several other related
  OSS libraries and tools (such as Jaeger) along the way."
