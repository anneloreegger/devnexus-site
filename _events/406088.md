  scalable and maintainable. But we better should also spend some time on making it
  more secure. With all that new Java releases and features also come new vulnerabilities
  and exploits. Because Java is everywhere, it has a huge attack surface which makes
  it interesting for hackers to search for vulnerabilities in Java and foremost in
  Java based applications. This sessions will explain what all these mystique acronyms
  like NVD, CVE, CVSS, CPU, PSU etc. mean and how they are related to Java security.
