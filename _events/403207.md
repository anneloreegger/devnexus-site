title: GraphQL from the Ground Up
description: "REST has become a standard for services on the internet, but it isn't
  without its drawbacks. GraphQL is a query language from Facebook that's caught on
  to address many of these issues. It provides API consumers with better visibility
  and more control over their data.\r\n\r\nWhere REST has endpoints and status codes,
  GraphQL has queries, mutations, types, and richer errors. It allows you to ask for
  precisely the data you need, to batch requests for parallel server processing, and
  even returns partial results in the face of downstream failures.\r\n\r\nIn this
  talk, we will explain our experience adopting GraphQL at New Relic. We will discuss
  the challenges and solutions we found - including the smaller community using GraphQL
  outside of the Javascript ecosystem, how we learned to think differently about the
  data we expose, and why you might consider adopting it yourself. We will also showcase
  the open-source libraries that we created to help both our own services and those
  of the wider community."
