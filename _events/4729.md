Maven Archetypes are powerful and can be used to generate any sort of Maven project. Still, the average Java developer is not fully aware of what is possible to do with Maven Archetypes. This session will explain the process of designing an archetype, then coding a prototype code, turning it into an archetype, designing a test suite to validate that the archetype is proven, and finally how to deploy to make use of it and help other developers in the team to create their cloud native applications following conventions and standards well defined in a template that can be verified through a CICD flow.
