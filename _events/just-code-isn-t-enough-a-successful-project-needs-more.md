title: Just Code isn't enough, A successful project needs more....
description: We’ve been working in evolving organizations with their projects and
  in the banking industry arise brand new digital transformation areas with cloud-native
  journeys. At this talk, we will share the importance of a healthy culture and soft
  skills beyond to have great coders. We modernize and improve our teams (and eventually
  an organization’s) to increase velocity for delivering software-based projects.
  Let us show you how we improve and influence people, processes, and eventual technology
  decisions.
