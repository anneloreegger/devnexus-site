title: Weaving Spring Cloud Gateway on Loom
description: We will provide a brief history of API gateways in Spring Cloud, including
  Zuul and why we built Spring Cloud Gateway to replace it. Then we will give a short
  primer on how the gateway routes and filters requests. We will then introduce how
  Spring Cloud Gateway can work in servlet containers using virtual threads on Java
  21. We will compare and contrast this new functionality to the original WebFlux-based
  Spring Cloud Gateway.
