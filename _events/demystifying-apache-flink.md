description: "As Data Streaming is taking over the world one event at a time, you
  cannot ignore it. Getting fresh and consistent data to the right place in the right
  format gives your company a competitive edge.\r\nYou are probably asking yourself,
  but what is this streaming all about? If you are new to this, don't worry; this
  session is for you! Join me in delving into Flink's architecture and building scalable
  and robust data processing pipelines for real-time data. You will learn about Flink's
  core concepts, like event time processing, state management, and components architecture.
  This session is designed for beginners but can be a suitable refreshment for experienced
  data streaming engineers."
