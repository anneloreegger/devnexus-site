This talk will focus on Edge Processing by taking advantage of deep learning capabilities of IoT devices as a cluster, by moving away from processing simple sensory data to deriving meaningful reasoning using Java. That is demonstrated by forming a group of intelligent devices as a single unit using 125 Raspberry Pis vs. 500+ GPU cores. This presentation will also explore JVM capabilities on ARM and X86 architectures, as well as large scale data mining on embedded GPUs such as Jetson Xavier and TX2.
