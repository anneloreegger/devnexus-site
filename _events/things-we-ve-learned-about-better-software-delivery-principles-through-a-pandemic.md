title: Things we've learned about better software delivery principles through a pandemic
description: "Since early 2020, software delivery has undergone quite a shift in process
  and practices and how we understand \"high-performing engineering teams.\" At the
  same time, the demands placed on our development and operations teams have continued
  to increase.\r\nWith anonymous data collected from over 1M+ devs, 45K+ orgs, and
  250M+ workflows, we've found some interesting insights into better DevOps practices.
  In this session, we will seek to uncover what this unique dataset can tell us about
  high-performing teams, and steps to get there as a business."
