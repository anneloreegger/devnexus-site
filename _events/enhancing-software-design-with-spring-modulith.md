title: Enhancing Software Design with Spring Modulith
description: "Having more tools in your tool belt and knowing when to use each one
  is a crucial aspect of modern design and architecture. In this talk, I want to introduce
  you to a new tool: Spring Modulith. This innovative tool is reshaping how we approach
  software structure, especially in the debate between using Microservices or a Monolithic
  framework. The central question we'll explore is how to create software that's flexible
  and can adapt to the evolving needs of a business.\r\n\r\nSpring Modulith is designed
  for those working with Spring Boot, offering a way to efficiently organize and evolve
  software projects. Here’s what we’ll delve into:\r\n\r\nDefining and managing logical
  modules within Spring Boot applications using Spring Modulith.\r\n\r\nUtilizing
  Spring Modulith’s tools for structural validation tests, ensuring each component
  functions correctly and cohesively.\r\n\r\nDocumenting the architecture of your
  application, facilitating better collaboration and future modifications.\r\n\r\nImplementing
  interactions between modules in a way that maintains their independence yet allows
  for effective communication.\r\n\r\nMonitoring real-time interactions between modules
  during the software’s operation.\r\n\r\nA highlight of this talk is a live coding
  demonstration, where I’ll show Spring Modulith in action. This will be insightful
  for both seasoned Spring Boot users and newcomers alike.\r\n\r\nJoin us to discover
  how Spring Modulith can enhance your toolkit, making your software projects more
  adaptable and aligned with the dynamic landscape of business requirements."
