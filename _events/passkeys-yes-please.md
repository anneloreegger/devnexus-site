title: Passkeys...Yes Please!
description: "\r\nDo you or someone you know reuse passwords? How much entropy do
  your passwords have? Have you selected passwords that are truly random? Do you and
  your entire family use a password manager? In 2022, over 24 billion passwords were
  exposed by hackers. With passwords, attackers can steal your identity, money, and
  leverage your computing resources to attack other users.\r\n\r\nPasswords are a
  way of life, but do they have to be? WebAuthn is probably best known for its ability
  to provide multi factor authentication, but it has more recently gained attention
  under the name Passkeys as a replacement for passwords.\r\n\r\nIn this session,
  Rob will teach you all there is to know Passkeys. He will  also walk you through
  a demo Spring application that leverages Passkeys so you can see first hand what
  it takes to implement Passkeys in your applications."
