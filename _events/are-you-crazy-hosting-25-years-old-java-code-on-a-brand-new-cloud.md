title: Are you crazy? hosting 25 years old java code on a brand-new cloud?
description: Hosting legacy Java code on a modern cloud platform poses unique challenges.
  The age gap between the legacy code and the cutting-edge cloud environment requires
  careful consideration of compatibility, capability, performance, debuggability,
  observability, and security. If we are looking for a first-class cloud-native experience,
  then we need to focus on re-architecting, refactoring, and retargeting the code.
  On a positive note, this process provides an opportunity to enhance the systemâ€™s
  scalability, resilience, and maintainability using the latest cloud technologies.
  Enter application modernization! This session presents a practical approach to bridging
  the gap between legacy systems and modern execution environments. Attendees will
  learn not only best practices around application modernisation but also gain insights
  into how this approach turns challenges into opportunities for innovation, resulting
  in a more agile, scalable, and future-proof system.
