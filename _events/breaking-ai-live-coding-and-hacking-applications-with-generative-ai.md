title: 'Breaking AI: Live coding and hacking applications with Generative AI'
description: Is your organisation ready to revolutionize your coding experience with
  generative AI tools, like copilot, ChatGPT, or code whisperer? Do you know how to
  code safely with generative AI tools increasing your delivery speed without compromising
  security? In this session, we’ll discuss some of the dangers of generative AI, including
  hallucinations and security risks. We’ll live code a Spring coffee shop application
  using copilot, and ChatGPT, and live hack the results, showing how the generated
  code can be exploited in a running app. We’ll uncover generated SQL injections,
  Cross site scripting, directory traversal and more. Don't miss this electrifying
  opportunity to explore the cutting edge of coding technology. Join us and embark
  on a journey where velocity meets security, and innovation knows no bounds. Secure
  your spot now and get ready to code like never before! In this session you'll learn
  how you can leverage the power of AI to increase your velocity while mitigating
  risks and staying secure.
