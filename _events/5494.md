<b>Join us for the annual Women in Tech Breakfast at DevNexus.  
We'll discuss "the pipeline problem," common obstacles, 
and proven strategies to succeed with our panelists:  Emily Jiang, Mala Gupta, and Ixchel Ruiz.</b>

We've all heard buzz around the "pipeline" and how this affects diversity in our workplaces.
<ul>
<li>What are your experiences?</li>
<li> What worked for you? </li>
<li>Are you thinking about a career move but not acting on it?</li>
<li>Are you afraid to talk about work life balance?</li>
<li>Are you in the right workplace, utilizing your full potential?</li>
<li>What's holding you back?</li>
</ul>
<b>In the multi-part breakfast, we'll..</b>
<ul>
<li>Break down some data about YOU--the women in the room</li>
<li>Challenge each other to actively take part in the conversation</li>
<li>Hear from our panelists and others who have conquered that fear, that challenge</li>
<li>Start the change today.</li>
</ul>

Tips and tricks will be provided.  Great connections are yours to make.
