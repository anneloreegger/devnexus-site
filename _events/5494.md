Join us
for the annual Women in Tech Breakfast at DevNexus.  We'll
discuss "the pipeline problem," common obstacles, and proven
strategies to succeed with our panelists: Emily
Jiang and Ixchel
Ruiz.

We've all
heard buzz around the "pipeline" and how this affects diversity in
our workplaces.  What are your experiences? What worked for
you? Are you thinking about a career move but not acting on
it?  Are you afraid to talk about work life balance? Are you
in the right workplace, utilizing your full potential?  What's
holding you back? 

In the
multi-part breakfast, we'll..
 Break down some data about YOU--the
women in the room
Challenge each other to actively take part in the conversation
Hear from our panelists and others who have conquered that fear, that challenge
Start the
change today.
