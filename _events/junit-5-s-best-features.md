title: JUnit 5's Best Features
description: The team that rewrote JUnit in version 5 did a fantastic job improving
  the platform while maintaining backward compatibility. Many Java developers don't
  realize how many new cool capabilities have been added to the framework since the
  initial 5.0 release.  This talk will cover topics like the set of useful functional
  interfaces available, how to do parameterized tests with various sources, lazy loading
  of error messages, and more.
