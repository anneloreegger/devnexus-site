title: 'The Kafka Consumer: An Unexpected Journey of Data Consumption'
description: "Once your data is stored on your Apache Kafka® cluster, the next step
  is to consume that data and do something interesting with it. Enter: Kafka Consumers.
  We all know how to set up a Kafka Consumer to poll data… but do you know how a consumer
  fetches the data from the cluster? Let’s find out!\r\n\r\nEvery call to consumer.poll()
  is translated into a low-level request which is sent along to the brokers for fulfillment.
  In this session, we’ll join Kafka Consumers as they embark on their epic adventure
  to consume your data. First, see how these clients band together in a single fellowship
  and follow the guidance of their consumer group coordinator. Then, follow a request
  from an initial call to poll(), all the way to disk, and back to the client with
  your data via the broker’s final response. Along the way, we’ll explore a number
  of client and broker configurations that affect how these requests are handled and
  discuss the metrics that you can monitor to keep track of every stage of the consumer
  life cycle.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this session, you’ll know the ins and outs of your
  Kafka Consumer requests, making your next debugging or performance analysis session
  a breeze."
