title: Jakarta EE 11 - Performance and Developer Productivity
description: "With a baseline on Java 21, Jakarta EE 11 has a focus on Performance
  and Developer Productivity. Built-in support for Virtual Threads and Records are
  some examples of this.\r\n\r\nWe will back the tape a little and look at how the
  namespace change from `javax.*` to `jakarta.*` in Jakarta EE 9 impacted the entire
  Java ecosystem. Then move on to the cool new features introduced in Jakarta EE 10
  before embarking on an adventurous journey with Jakarta EE 11. Everything is backed
  up by live coding demos.\r\n\r\nAfter this session, you will have an understanding
  of the fundamentals of Jakarta EE, as well as know how to quickly get started with
  Jakarta EE at your own pace."
