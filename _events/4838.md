Have you ever wondered how much ambient radiation is in your house or place of work?  Ok... probably not.  But you may have thought how can I move processing of critical information closer to the edge.   In this talk we will show you how Spring can be used in an edge computing topology.  Using Spring Cloud Stream, Spring Batch and Spring Cloud Data Flow we will connect to a geiger counter and process the information and send the results based on a scheduled event or in cases of certain events immediately send the information. 
 And all instrument readings will be in bananas :-) instead of sieverts or rems.
