Have you ever wondered how much ambient radiation is in your home or workplace? OK ... probably not. But maybe you have thought, “How can I move processing of critical information closer to the edge?” Or perhaps you are now wondering what the “edge” is? In this talk, we will demonstrate how to move the processing of data from the cloud to the edge. Using Spring Cloud Stream, Spring Cloud Task, and Spring Cloud Data Flow, we will also show how to create streams that capture the existing data flows from our IOT Device and merge in the data from our new edge devices. And all instrument readings will be in bananas :-) instead of sieverts or rems.
