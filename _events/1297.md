This session introduces Apache Kafka, an open source Streaming Platform. Apache Kafka goes far beyond scalable, high volume messaging. In addition, you can leverage Kafka Connect for integration and the Kafka Streams API for building lightweight Stream Processing applications. The open source Confluent Platform adds further components such as a Schema Registry, REST Proxy, Clients for different programming languages and Connectors for different technologies and databases. Live Demos included.
