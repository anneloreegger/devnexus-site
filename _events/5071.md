The reactive revolution continues. For as much as we've been talking about reactive programming in Spring for the last few years the journey has only just begun. Join me, Spring Developer Advocate Josh Long (@starbuxman), and we'll take our reactive applications further, looking at how to build microservices for cloud platforms like Pivotal Application Service (Cloud Foundry) and PKS (Kubernetes).

Some of the things we may cover include:

reactive NoSQL data access
reactive SQL data access with R2DBC
orchestration and reliability patterns like client-side loadbalancing, circuit breakers, and hedging
messaging and service integration with Apache Kafka or RSocket
API gateways with Spring Cloud Gateway and patterns like rate limiting and
API adapters
serverless programming with Spring Cloud Function and project Riff
reactive authentication and authorization with Spring Security
