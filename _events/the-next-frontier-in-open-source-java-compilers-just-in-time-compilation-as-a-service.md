title: 'The Next Frontier in Open Source Java Compilers: Just-In-Time Compilation
  as a Service'
description: "For Java developers, the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is key to improved
  performance. However, in a container world, the performance gains are often negated
  due to CPU and memory consumption constraints. To help solve this issue, the Eclipse
  OpenJ9 JVM provides JITServer technology, which separates the JIT compiler from
  the application.\r\n\r\nJITServer allows the user to employ much smaller containers
  enabling a higher density of applications, resulting in cost savings for end-users
  and/or cloud providers. Because the CPU and memory surges due to JIT compilation
  are eliminated, the user has a much easier task of provisioning resources for his/her
  application. Additional advantages include: faster ramp-up time, better control
  over resources devoted to compilation, increased reliability (JIT compiler bugs
  no longer crash the application) and amortization of compilation costs across many
  application instances.\r\n\r\nWe will dig into JITServer technology, showing the
  challenges of implementation, detailing its strengths and weaknesses and illustrating
  its performance characteristics. For the cloud audience we will show how it can
  be deployed in containers, demonstrate its advantages compared to a traditional
  JIT compilation technique and offer practical recommendations about when to use
  this technology."
