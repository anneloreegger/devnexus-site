title: Configuration security as a game of pursuit intercept
description: In this session we will take a look at the emerging field of cloud security
  posture management and how we can approach the problem space using a class of board
  games known as pursuit/intercept. Using the game Scotland Yard as a visual illustration
  we'll explore the cognitive and technical limitations that all CSPM systems face
  and what you should look for when evaluating the strengths and weakness of CSPM
  vendors.
