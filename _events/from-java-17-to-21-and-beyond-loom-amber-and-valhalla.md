title: 'From Java 17 to 21 and beyond: Loom, Amber and Valhalla'
description: "The two years realese cadence of LTS versions gives the entire Java
  ecosystem the opportunity to accelerate. It also brings the new features Java has
  to offer faster, so that developers can improve applications readability, maintainability
  as well as development productivity. \r\nThis presentation covers three of the new
  features of the JDK: Amber, Loom and Valhalla. Amber is about bringing pattern matching
  to the Java language. It's currently added bit by bit: records, pattern matching
  for instanceof, for switch, and record pattern matching. Loom offers a new concurrent
  programming model. With Loom, you can write your code in a synchronous way, without
  any callback, and execute it asynchronously, with all the performances benefits
  you may expect. It is a preview feature of the JDK 19. Valhalla brings a new kind
  of objects to the language, so that you do not have to choose between performances
  and abstraction. Valhalla will add user defined primitive types to the Java language
  as well value types."
