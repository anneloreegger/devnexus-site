description: "If you're a developer, chances you've used a third-party library for
  various parts of your projects. Third-party libraries offer so much functionality
  that they are essential to most teams success. So, how do you make your own library?
  How do you go from your teams \"utils\" folder, to a package on npm that can be
  installed across your organization? In this talk, we will look at how to publish
  a library, set it up to follow best practices, and ensure you maintain code quality.
