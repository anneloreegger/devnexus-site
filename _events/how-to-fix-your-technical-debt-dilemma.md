title: How to Fix Your Technical Debt Dilemma
description: "When you think about 1,700 developer days (or 4.8 years of time) in
  the engineering world, how does that make you feel? To me, it feels like infinity.
  Technical debt can show up like this in an organization. It’s a backlog of issues—migrating
  software, cleaning up code, and fixing security vulnerabilities—that can paralyze
  engineering organizations and lead to burnout. And the reality of modern applications
  is that they naturally accrue tech debt. They are composed of large and diverse
  codebases and ecosystems—a supply chain of custom, third-party, and open source
  software. Dependencies are changing frequently and evolve at their own pace. Not
  updating leads to critical bugs, performance, and security issues. The key to fixing
  your technical debt dilemma is continuous software modernization. You’ll never get
  behind when maintenance work that would normally take many months of manual effort
  can be automated and completed with a PR in minutes. This is how developers stay
  energized and your business can thrive.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll introduce OpenRewrite,
  an open source, auto-refactoring technology that was born at Netflix in 2016. It
  uses sophisticated, fast code search capabilities in combination with powerful change
  recipes that actually fix the code. I’ll share a use case of a common issue remediation—running
  a recipe live that fixes the issue and executing it across 300 million lines of
  open source code. The recipe will be made available in open source for you to apply
  to your own codebase at the end of the session.\r\n\r\nKey Take-aways:\r\n\r\n*
  Technical debt can be reframed as continuous software modernization with robust
  automation that not only finds the issues, but fixes them regularly.\r\n* OpenRewrite
  uses a similar approach as an IDE to automate refactoring, but takes it out of single
  person, single repo mode, so it can be delivered in different ways. The refactoring
  is 100% accurate and style preserving.\r\n* You can see immediate results using
  the open source change recipes from OpenRewrite—just try out one recipe and get
  days of your time back!\r\n* Moderne has a Saas platform that works with OpenRewrite
  recipes to help you execute continuous software modernization at scale—across repositories
  simultaneously\r\n"
