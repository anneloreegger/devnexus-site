title: 'Don''t Call it a Comeback: SQL in Cloud AI and ML'
description: 'While Python and specialized ML libraries dominate the AI/ML landscape,
  SQL''s simplicity and power remain invaluable for developers. This session will
  demonstrate how SQL seamlessly integrates with Google Cloud Platform''s AI/ML tools,
  enabling developers to leverage their existing SQL skills for efficient data handling
  and model building. We''ll cover techniques for data exploration, feature engineering,
  and model training directly within BigQuery, and showcase how to deploy and manage
  models at scale using Vertex AI''s SQL interface. Through hands-on examples and
  code demonstrations, you''ll gain practical insights into harnessing SQL''s capabilities
  to streamline your Cloud AI/ML development process. '
