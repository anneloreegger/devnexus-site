title: 'Wireguard, TLS and Workload Identity: The Backbone of Modern Service Networking'
description: "Zero Trust Networking has become a standard marketing buzzword but the
  underlying principles are critical for modern microservice-style architectures.
  Authentication, authorizations, policy, etc. can be difficult to implement between
  services and do so in a maintainable way. Google invented their own transparent
  encryption and authorization protocol called \"ALTS\" back in 2007 to serve the
  application layer of Google's Borg workload scheduler, but we don't see others using
  it outside Google.\r\n\r\nIn this session we look at existing technology like TLS
  and newcomer Wireguard and see how these technologies come together to provide a
  secure foundation for workload identity and modern service-to-service networking.
  We will see how to accomplish exactly what Google did with ALTS but in a more open-source
  friendly way."
