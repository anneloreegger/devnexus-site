title: Unblock your Event-Loop using Worker Threads
description: "JavaScriptâ€™s single-threaded and event-driven design enables developers
  to create applications that excel at processing events and coordinating asynchronous
  I/O. Unfortunately these same applications stall completely if they execute CPU-bound
  JavaScript code that blocks the event-loop. The introduction of worker threads opens
  up new possibilities for executing CPU-bound JavaScript code, without impacting
  application responsiveness.\r\n\r\nJoin this session for a practical introduction
  to worker threads! We'll examine an application that suffers reduced throughput
  and increased latency due to CPU-bound tasks blocking the event-loop. We'll then
  demonstrate how worker threads can be used to address the situation, and perform
  load testing to prove that our updated application is significantly more responsive.
