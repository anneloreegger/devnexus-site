title: Developer Experience is central to DevOps success
description: 'Developer Experience (DX) is not just describing the "frontend" experience
  - it''s about every aspect of the experience your developers (internal and external)
  have with your product, tooling, systems, etc. Platform engineering has emerged
  as this general way to remove developer toil, but DX is more than that, encompassing
  everything from deployment pipelines to IaC practices to developer efficiencies
  to even UI/UX. In this talk we will seek to bring into focus some of the principles
  of DevOps (collaboration, communication, shared responsibility) and how a strong
  DX mindset can bring Dev and Ops together. '
