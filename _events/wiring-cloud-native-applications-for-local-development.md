title: Wiring Cloud Native applications for local development
description: "Despite the quality of modern cloud-native tools, the user experience
  for the inner and outer loops are still radically different, which introduces friction
  and slows down developer productivity. \r\n\r\nDevelopment setups are application-centric,
  while production environments deal with deployments and tools required for operations
  teams to keep applications up and running. In this session, we explore tools to
  simplify both sides to improve developer productivity by following a platform engineering
  and polyglot approach. \r\n\r\nThis session demonstrates and provides hands-on experience
  on:\r\nHow to enable developers with standard application-level APIs to solve common
  distributed application challenges by using Dapr.\r\nHow to equip developers and
  product managers with consistent and polyglot feature flags with OpenFeature.\r\nAnd
  how to develop locally with these tools, outside of a Kubernetes Cluster, by using
  Testcontainers. \r\n"
