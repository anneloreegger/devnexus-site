title: Community hacks to enhance your career
description: "Do you feel it’s no longer enough to just be a great developer? Does
  advancing your career mean you have to be blogging, speaking at conferences, engaging
  on social media, committing to open source and other things distracting you from
  actually building software?\r\n\r\nYou’ll do well to ensure that the people making
  decisions about your career are hearing and seeing your name and associating it
  with progress and other cool and positive things (and truth, they probably aren’t
  looking at your code).\r\n\r\nIn this session we’ll explore some of the best practices
  that assist in not having to do it all from scratch. Knowing what you are doing
  can give you an easier path to visible contributions to the community."
