title: 'Ignore Previous Instructions: Embracing AI Red Teaming'
description: In this talk, we will explore the journey of Red Teaming from its origins
  to its transformation into AI Red Teaming, highlighting its pivotal role in shaping
  the future of Large Language Models (LLMs) and beyond. Drawing from my firsthand
  experiences developing and deploying the largest generative red teaming platform
  to date, I will share insightful antidotes and real-world examples. We will explore
  how adversarial red teaming fortifies AI applications at every layerâ€”protecting
  platforms, businesses, and consumers. This includes safeguarding the external application
  interface, reinforcing LLM guardrails, and enhancing the security of the LLMs' internal
  algorithms. Join me as we uncover the critical importance of adversarial strategies
  in securing the AI landscape.
