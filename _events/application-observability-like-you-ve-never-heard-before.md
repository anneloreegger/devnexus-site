title: Application Observability like you've never heard before
description: "Do you regularly spend sleepless nights desperately trying to make sense
  of cryptic error messages that seem to have been penned by a particularly grumpy
  Shakespearean ghostwriter? Are you frequently wondering about what your application
  is doing in production?\r\nPlease join us on this example-driven journey where we
  go through some of the more advanced topics of Observability, and we dive into the
  toolsets available for you today to instrument your application so that it can tell
  you what it is doing and why. We will explore how to instrument your JVM-based application
  without vendor lock-in using Micrometer, OpenTelemetry, Grafana, OpenZipkin, Prometheus,
  OpenMetrics, etc, so you can have a much better sense of what is going on inside
  of your app."
