JavaScript is in every browser. It’s flexible, dynamically, very dynamic, and somewhat flawed. Because of its shortcomings, there are countless languages that transpile to JavaScript. One of the most popular of these is TypeScript, which provides type-safety and other features like generics, as well as early implementations of new JavaScript features. TypeScript has become even more popular with the newer versions of Angular. However, developers often don’t take full advantage of the language, instead reverting to pure JavaScript when there’s a much better (and strongly typed) TypeScript alternative. In this session, we’ll take look at common features developers don’t use, and show you how to get the best out of this awesome language.
