There is a hidden side to agile adoption, one that is rarely spoken about at conferences. The dead ends that we reached, the frustrations within the teams, the roadblocks we hit and the staff turnover that occurred. Things that can not only halt an agile adoption, but if not dealt with, that can fracture a team that is not prepared for it. This session will be more encompassing than the path to success - it will cover the trials and tribulations of a team in transition.
