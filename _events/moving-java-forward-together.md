title: Moving Java Forward Together
description: Modern application development is unrecognizable without Java. Rather
  than resting on our laurels, Oracleâ€™s leadership continues to drive Java innovation
  forward. Equally important is Oracle's continuing stewardship of the Java ecosystem
  because without you, the community, Java doesn't move forward. The role you play
  is critical in ensuring Java's future for today as well as tomorrow and for the
  next decades ahead of us. In this session, you'll learn about the many ways YOU
  can help ensure Java remains the leading choice to build the future.
