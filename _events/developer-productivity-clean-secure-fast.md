title: Developer Productivity - clean | secure | fast
description: "The old maxim of you can have it working or on time but not both is
  often applied to software development.\r\nSomehow though we’ve reached the stage
  where we are expected to deliver functioning code on time - all the time. Isn’t
  that what Agile and DevOps etc are all about?   Productivity is king after all.\r\nNow
  though we’ve got to deal with an increased focus on security - can we add that in
  and still deliver as before or does something break?\r\nIn this session we’ll introduce
  you to several ways to deal with the challenge. From better understanding of the
  problem to new thoughts about how we work.  We’ll help you think differently about
  productivity and show you how to take the first steps towards have your cake and
  eating it too"
