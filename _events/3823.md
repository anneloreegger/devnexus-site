The 12 factors represent the expression of cloud application perfection, yet the cloud-agnostic Kubernetes gets us closer to it! Kubernetes flexibility complements the 12 factors apps with their flavours across frameworks and cloud providers. In this session I will showcase how applications complying with the 12 factors can graciously take advantage of the best practices with Kubernetes. Each of the principles will be illustrated by a demo.
