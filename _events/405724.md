title: Cross-Platform Cloud CI/CD
description: "More and more teams are leveraging cross-platform development for their
  web, mobile PWA, iOS, and Android applications. However, if you are still leveraging
  traditional CI/CD or manual deployment processes, you can still experience release
  delays and different DX and UX across platforms. A unified system for cross-platform
  builds and deploys can prevent knowledge silos, speed up releases, and ensure an
  efficient process no matter what the platform. This talk will cover the considerations
  when building a CI/CD system to manage web and mobile deployments, and options for
  implementing a cross-platform CI/CD solution in the cloud.\r\n\r\nWhat you'll learn:\r\n-
  How web, Android, and iOS deployments are different\r\n- The specific factors to
  consider when building a cross-platform CI/CD strategy\r\n- Options for implementing
  a cloud CI/Cd strategy for all your deployments across multiple platforms"
