title: 'Coding Fast and Slow: Applying Kahneman''s Insights to Improve Development
  Practices and Efficiency'
description: "Embark on an exciting journey into the intersection of psychology, software
  development, and Developer Productivity Engineering (DPE) as we explore how Nobel
  laureate Daniel Kahneman's groundbreaking work on the psychology of judgment and
  decision-making can optimize your development practices while conserving cognitive
  resources. Discover the impact of System 1 and System 2 thinking on the software
  development process, and learn to strike the perfect balance between \"fast\" intuitive
  thinking and \"slow\" deliberative reasoning.\r\nWe'll delve into practical DPE
  strategies for reducing mental fatigue and minimizing context switches, focusing
  on techniques like build system performance optimization, test parallelization,
  \ AI-powered test selection, and developer productivity observability. By leveraging
  these best practices, you'll enhance your and your team's productivity and maintain
  focus on high-value tasks.\r\nWhether you're an experienced developer seeking to
  boost your performance or a curious newcomer eager to learn about the connections
  between the human mind, software development, and DPE, this talk is for you. Join
  us for an exhilarating adventure into the fast and slow worlds of coding, and uncover
  new ways to maximize your cognitive resources."
