title: The Death Star and the ultimate vulnerability
description: "The Death Star from Star Wars was an impressive though fictional feat
  of engineering, but it had a fatal flaw that was exploited by the rebels. Similarly,
  modern applications are at risk due to the many open-source dependencies used worldwide
  that can contain vulnerabilities. Some are just mistakes, and others, like that
  iconic exhaust port, were deliberately created. \r\n\r\nManaging these components
  and ensuring their security is crucial to prevent successful attacks. This session
  will take you to a galaxy far far away, to look at what went wrong in the Empire's
  supply chain to cause such a vulnerability to be introduced. By understanding the
  risks and using the right tools, we can avoid a catastrophe like the Death Starâ€™s
  destruction and put a stop to any rebel scum."
