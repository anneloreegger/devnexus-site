title: Dude, what happened to my developer-first cloud? Production-easy Spring Cloud
description: "Dude, what happened to my developer-first cloud? Production-easy Spring
  Cloud\r\n\r\nIf you've used Spring Boot & Spring Cloud to build robust production
  systems, you know you love how it makes your microservices more stable, resilient,
  scalable, and manageable.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, certain cloud environments took
  a similar, developer-first approach. Getting to production was as easy as pushing
  a JAR to the platform and letting it do all the heavy lifting, letting you focus
  on creating and delivering mission-critical features to your users.\r\n\r\nRemember,
  no one ever got praise and a raise for crafting the perfect Kubernetes YAML file...which
  is the universe's way of reminding you that you want -- you need -- to focus on
  writing great code, not on endlessly tweaking infrastructure.\r\n\r\nIn this session,
  the presenter will examine the pieces needed for a Spring Boot developer-first cloud
  and then demonstrate how to unlock those pieces using intelligent deployment options
  that allow you to focus on what you do best: creating mission critical, game changing
  applications while the platform takes care of the rest. \r\n\r\nCome to this session
  to learn how to increase your company's -- and your -- value by getting back to
  what you do best and what brings you greatest joy: writing amazing code and delivering
  needed features to your users!"
