Understanding application behavior is important in any environment. The most efficient way to observe application behavior relies on metrics, key/value pairs of numerical data. This session will compare the capabilities of libraries like Micrometer, OpenTelemetry, and MicroProfile metrics. We'll also explore how gathered data can be used to observe and understand application behavior in order to determine what should be measured.
