Join the amazing Heather VanCura, Director of the JCP, for Code ‘n Coffee! Heather will take the stage to moderate a panel focused on Tips to Grow Your Technical Career. She’s bringing some of the best and brightest minds together to share their knowledge to help you find a path to achieve your career goals.

This session is open to anyone attending Devnexus who is interested in learning how to take your career to the next level. Over the next few weeks we’ll be tweeting out more information on panelists and what to expect, as we countdown the days to Devnexus. Look for the hashtag - #CodeNCoffee - and follow @groundbreakers for more news on who you’ll see on the stage with Heather.
