title: Sociotechnical Platform Engineering
description: "devOps practices help reduce friction to production for technologists.
  Once an application has user traffic, user experience should become a priority,
  but at what cost?\r\n\r\nThis talk will connect human centered devOps & SRE practices
  across a value stream to explore how platforms balance developer experience against
  production stability over time, and how process dependencies factor into overall
  platform success. \r\n\r\nthis talk will Explore:\r\n- How pipelines are value streams\r\n-
  A general-purpose value stream map for platforms\r\n- Dependency (wardley) maps
  for platform processes\r\n- Aligning SLIs, SLOs, & SLAs across our platform VSM\r\n-
  Establishing Error Budgets\r\n- Chaos Engineering & Complexity Science\r\n"
