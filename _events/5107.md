Join Cecili as she talks about her passion project to create an application to suggest if items can be composted, recycled, or reused. In this talk, attendees will learn high level concepts of machine learning looking at this project's use of Google's Tensorflow for JavaScript. By the end of this talk, attendees will understand how to identify images of food items and display whether or not an item is compostable. No previous understanding of machine learning necessary!
