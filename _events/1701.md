Kotlin comes to us from Jetbrains the same people that make the IntelliJ IDEA IDE. Designed to run on the JVM and interop cleanly with exisiting Java classes, Kotlin provides a number of upgrades from standard Java development. More than just another language tour with and ceaseless parade of tidbits and nuggets, this talk is a walkthrough of actively developed projects. We'll look at various language features in the context of actual code rather than contrived examples designed to make the language shine.
