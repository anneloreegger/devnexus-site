title: Jakarta EE 10 and Beyond
description: "Java EE has been re-branded to Jakarta EE and moved to truly open source
  governance under the Eclipse Foundation. There have so far been several successful
  releases under the Eclipse Foundation - Jakarta EE 8, 9, 9.1 and now 10. This session
  overviews what this means and offers a brief tour of Jakarta EE 10. We will also
  look at what the future might bring.\r\n\r\nJakarta EE 10 brings some long pending
  updates to key technologies like Jakarta Security, Concurrency, REST, Persistence
  and Faces. It also brings the Core Profile targeted to next-generation runtimes
  such as Open Liberty, Helidon and Quarkus. Down the line in Jakarta EE 11, there
  may be further changes afoot for Jakarta Configuration, NoSQL, Messaging, Security,
  Concurrency, REST, Persistence/Data, gRPC and MVC. You can contribute to all this
  and more.\r\n\r\nYou should come to this session with your thinking caps on and
  your sleeves rolled up. There is much to help move forward together that really
  matters."
