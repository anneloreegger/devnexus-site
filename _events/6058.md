We talk about upgrades to our application libraries and our JVM versions but tend to leave our test code and libraries to last bit. This talk discusses some of the possible reasons why we wait on upgrading our test code and then shows some of the high-level changes that JUnit 5 brought. As with all good talks, there we be a walkthrough of taking some sample code and migrating it up to JUnit 5.
