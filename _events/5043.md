This talk is a fast-paced introduction to the Micronaut framework, from creating the first app to orchestrating a microservice federation and deploying to the cloud. We will cover the basics of writing Micronaut apps, communication between services, building for resiliency, managing configuration, and deploying to a cloud provider. By the time we're finished, you'll have a good understanding of the features of the framework and be ready to start building and deploying your own apps with Micronaut. Buckle up and start the countdown!
