title: Automated software refactoring with OpenRewrite and Generative AI
description: "The software industrial revolution has arrived. Software is now 80%
  open source and third-party\r\nand 20% proprietary code that stitches it together
  into business-critical applications. In these large and diversely composed codebases,
  dependencies change frequently at their own pace and security vulnerabilities can
  be introduced at any time by anyone. Not updating software regularly leads to critical
  bugs, performance, and security issues (plus your code can just get harder to work
  with!).\r\n\r\nMass code refactoring in these massive codebases is a multi-point
  operation that requires accuracy and consistency. It’s about affecting change across
  many individual cursor positions in thousands of repositories representing tens
  or hundreds of millions of lines of code. Whether you’re migrating frameworks or
  guarding against vulnerabilities, this requires coordination, tracking, and accuracy.
  \r\n\r\nThis is not a problem AI can solve alone. AI, like many humans, is not good
  at math and programming. AI needs a computer just like a human does.\r\n\r\nIn this
  talk, we’ll discuss automated code remediation with the deterministic OpenRewrite
  refactoring engine, a technology born at Netflix in 2016. It’s built on manipulating
  the Lossless Semantic Tree (LST) representation of code with recipes (programs)
  that result in 100% accurate style-preserving code transformations. It is a rule-based,
  authoritative system.\r\n\r\nThen we’ll show how to couple the precision of a rules-based
  system with the power of AI.\r\nWe'll demonstrate a generative AI procedure that
  samples source code to identify defects and uses OpenRewrite to fix them. This is
  a general purpose pattern you're going to start seeing a lot of — \"ChatGPT gets
  a computer\" (with OpenRewrite as the computer in this case)."
