title: Upgrading a Legacy Java EE App with Style
description: In the span of several weeks, we took a legacy app that had been running
  in production for 12 years, moved it to git, mavenized it, upgraded from Java 6
  to Java 8, and upgraded from Java EE 5 to Java EE 7. Oh, and did I mention that
  it uses SOAP, JSP, and JSF 1.2? We did all this with a relatively minor amount of
  code changes, thanks to the backward compatibility of Java 8 and Java EE. Come to
  this session to learn how we did it, what issues we ran into, which app server we
  were using, and why we didn't move to a newer JDK, Java EE 8 or Jakarta EE.
