title: A Glance At The Java Performance Toolbox
description: "What's the first step to improving performance?\r\n\r\nIs it tuning
  the garbage collector? Writing clean(er) code?\r\nNo, the first step is understanding
  what's going on in your application!\r\n\r\nPerformance tuning starts with analysis,
  and JDK tools can help you gain insights on classes and threads and can perform
  live GC analysis or heap dump postprocessing: jcmd, jconsole, jstat, jmap and jfr.\r\n\r\nWe'll
  examine the functional visibility areas essential to Java and how these tools provide
  that information. Moreover, will discuss options on how to integrate information
  gathered from these tools with widespread monitoring systems like Prometheus.\r\n\r\nAfter
  this talk, you will be ready to understand what your application spends time on
  and why so you can start improving its performance with complete information."
