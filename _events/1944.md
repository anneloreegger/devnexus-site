Teams fail to achieve the full benefit of the "clean code" approach when they focus on the code and neglect the Agile process. The full title of Uncle Bob's "Clean Code" book is "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship".  This talk presents an depth look at necessary relationship between Clean Code software craftsmanship and the Agile methodology, identifies common scenarios and situations where teams may fall short of recognizing and respecting that relationship, and provides practical recommendations for achieving a fully integrated process of Agile Software Craftsmanship.
