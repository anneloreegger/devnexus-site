title: BDD from the Trenches
description: "Have you tried Behavior Driven Development and not gotten the expected
  results? Does the team get bogged down in arguments about whether a statement is
  a \"given\" or a \"when\"? Are you trying to understand scenarios that run multiple
  pages in length? Do your specifications break when the development team refactors
  the UI? \r\n\r\nThis talk will present BDD best practices learned by working with
  multiple teams over several years to avoid overly complex and brittle specifications,
  prevent BDD from being yet another source of \"truth\", and other obstacles that
  may prevent your teams from getting the full value out of the BDD practice"
