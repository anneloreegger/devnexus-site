title: Tuning Garbage Collection Algorithms for Cloud Java Applications
description: The garbage collector's performance is one key feature of the overall
  performance of any Java application. For many applications, the only tuning required
  is selecting the appropriate GC algorithm and increasing the heap size. More complex
  applications will require additional tuning, particularly for specific GC algorithms.
  Join this talk to gain a better understanding of how choosing and tuning the GC
  influences the performance of your containerized Java application.
