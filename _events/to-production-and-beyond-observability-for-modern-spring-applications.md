title: 'To Production and Beyond: Observability for Modern Spring Applications'
description: "You just deployed your application to prod. Congratulations! Is our
  mission accomplished and can we go home for the week even if it is just Tuesday?
  But before we pack up to go home, how will we know if we deployed a bug or if our
  last change caused a significant performance degradation? Also how can we know when
  network issues arise or if one of our dependencies goes down?\r\nIn this forward-looking
  presentation, we will answer these questions by looking into application observability
  using distributed tracing, metrics, correlated logs, and exemplars. We will explore
  how the latest developments in Micrometer, Spring Framework 6, Spring Boot 3, Prometheus,
  OpenZipkin, and OpenTelemetry will give you a better understanding about what is
  going on inside of your applications. \r\nWe will also discuss the future of Observability
  in Spring Boot and other methods of exploring your running application using Spring
  Boot Actuator, Spring Boot Admin and Spring HATEOAS along with related technologies
  like Eureka, Logbook and Swagger."
