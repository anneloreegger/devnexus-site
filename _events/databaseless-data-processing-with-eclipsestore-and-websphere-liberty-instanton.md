title: Databaseless Data Processing with EclipseStore and WebSphere Liberty InstantOn
description: 'More and more companies and organizations are using AI, ML, VR and big
  data in the cloud. 3 factors are most critical for all of them: high performance,
  low data storage costs, and simple, fast and cost-efficient implementation and maintenance.
  Traditional databases and persistence frameworks worked well so far, however for
  the beginning AI age they are too slow, implementing is complex, and databases are
  too expensive in the cloud. That''s why many innovative companies such as online
  banks or gaming companies have built their individual high-performance systems with
  pure Java with high effort to meet their requirements. Now, with EclipseStore there
  is a leight-weight and easy to use framework. EclipseStore enables databaseless
  high-performance in-memory data processing for modern cloud-native Java applications
  and microservices. It lets you store any Java object graph of any size and complexity
  seamlessly into any cloud binary data storage. Users benefit from ultra-fast in-memory
  data processing, up to 1000x faster queries, up to 99% cloud database cost savings,
  and unrivaled simplicity. WebSphere Liberty InstantOn enables EclipseStore cluster
  nodes starting in milliseconds without the need for using GraalVM native images. '
