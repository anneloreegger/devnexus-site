title: 'Java meets TypeScript: learn to build full-stack web apps with Spring Boot
  and React'
description: "As Java developers, we know the benefits of type-safety when building
  apps. The problem? Usually, that type-safety ends when we leave the server. What
  if it didn't have to be that way?\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you'll learn how
  to build a full-stack reactive web app through live code examples. We'll use Spring
  Boot and Java on the backend and React with TypeScript on the frontend, connecting
  the two with the new Hilla framework from Vaadin."
