title: Battling your Biased Brain
description: "Ever heard of the IKEA effect or the bandwagon-effect? In our efforts
  to delivering great software, there are numerous occasions where our brain tries
  to trick us. Donâ€™t fall for them!\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will dive into some well-known
  and researched cognitive biases that impact our judgments in our day-to-day jobs
  as software creators.\r\nWhen do they typically occur? And why are we falling into
  these traps from time to time?\r\n\r\nAfter this talk you'll have a better understanding
  of how your brain tricks you, how to make better decisions and in the end how to
  deliver some great software.\r\n\r\nA word of warning; during this talk you may
  get tricked!"
