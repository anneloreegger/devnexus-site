title: 'Black Friday Brilliance: Managing a Billion Transactions with Tech, Tactics,
  and Teamwork'
description: "The Black Friday and Cyber Monday period is one of the busiest times
  in the retail calendar, both in stores and online, and our customers rely on our
  infrastructure to support their businesses at this crucial time. Over this period
  in 2023 we processed over 1 billion requests to our APIs, and we managed this with
  greater than 99.99% availability! We've seen our request volume increase over 100x
  in the last 10 years, and managing this requires the right technologies, careful
  planning, and a great team of people.\r\n\r\nWith insightful commentary from a cross-section
  of our brilliant Dev team, I’ll talk you through how we scale our infrastructure
  on different Clouds, the technologies and processes that are put in place and problems
  we have had to overcome in the past. I’ll also give some insights into how the team
  works together over this busy period to keep everything running smoothly.\r\n"
