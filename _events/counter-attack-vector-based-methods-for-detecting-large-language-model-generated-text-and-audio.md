title: 'Counter Attack: Vector Based methods for Detecting Large Language Model Generated
  Text and Audio'
description: "The advent of large token width Large Language Models (LLMs) such as
  ChatGPT and their ilk has significantly increased the problem of reliable detection.
  Organizations are now using LLMs to generate text content with targeted precision
  at a massive scale with the objective of artificially amplifying false narratives
  and negative propaganda. As part of a broader Counter AI research program we have
  investigated ways for addressing this problem. In this presentation we will discuss
  and demonstrate one such promising technique called Masked Permutations. \r\n\r\nThis
  technique removes a subset of the words and phrases from an arbitrary input text
  and has the targeted LLM model “fill in the blanks” for a nontrivial collection
  of permutations. These permutations are then clustered using a manifold approximation
  technique. With the clustered projection of the LLM embedding vectors in hand, a
  proximity distance measurement from the original text is then used to determine
  likelihood of LLM generation. \r\n\r\nThis approach has shown great potential in
  experimentation as being a practical method of detection that has the potential
  to scale up as LLMs scale while offering an asymmetric cost advantage. The discussion
  will include a live software demonstration using a JHUAPL developed interactive
  3D XAI analysis tool called Trinity."
