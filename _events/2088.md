Historically, Grails applications that contain a browser-based front end have most often utilized server-side HTML generation built with Groovy Server Pages (GSP).  This approach makes sense for a lot of applications but not for all.  Modern web apps are often built as “Single Page Apps” (SPA) made up of a rich front end implemented in Javascript and stateless backend REST services for which Grails is perfectly suited.  To leverage the benefits of an approach like that Grails provides first-rate support for building SPAs with Grails 3 and part of that support comes in the way of Grails 3 Profiles specifically designed to jumpstart the development of web applications utilizing that type of architecture. This workshop will explore many details related to building a Single Page Application using React and Grails 3.  Topics include the following:
•Introduction To Grails 3
•Introduction To React
•The React Profile For Grails 3
•REST Services
•JSON Views
•Spring Security REST
•Tying It All Together

The workshop will include roughly 50% lecture and demonstrations and 50% hands-on lab work building a real application utilizing React on the front end, Grails 3 RESTservices on the backend and Spring Security to provide role-based authentication and authorization for securing access to various capabilities in the application.
