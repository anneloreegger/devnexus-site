title: Keeping It SAST-y
description: "SAST, SCA, DAST, IAST, RASP? What is the meaning of all these security
  tools and what do they mean to developers? With the threat to application security
  ever increasing, it is more important than ever to understand how to leverage tooling
  effectively to be your trusty sidekick in the battle against cybercrime.\r\n\r\nIn
  this session, we’ll dive into static application security testing (SAST), static
  analysis concepts, and the strategies behind it. We’ll also discuss how to take
  advantage of tools to painlessly improve code security."
