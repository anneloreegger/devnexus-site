title: 'Know Your Ingredients: Security Starts With the Source'
description: "One of the most neglected parts of application security is the ingredients
  that go into developing software. Over 80 percent of code used in enterprise applications
  comes from open source dependencies, but how much attention goes towards the provenance
  and security of those packages. And in the pursuit of accelerated software development,
  developers are leveraging more and more libraries and also code “created” by generative
  AI algorithms, so how do you prevent defects or malicious payloads from compromising
  your security?\r\n\r\nThis is analogous to a restaurant where you invest in modern
  decor, professional chefs, and world class service. But if you don’t get fresh,
  quality ingredients delivered daily, the taste and hygiene of the food will suffer.
  Securing the software supply chain is a huge undertaking for the entire tech industry,
  and we will talk about some of the ongoing efforts by open source projects, foundations,
  and corporations to help us all know our ingredients."
