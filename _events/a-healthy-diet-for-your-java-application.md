title: A Healthy diet for your Java application
description: "Have you ever faced OutOfMemoryError? Was it in your CI or during the
  local run? Maybe you faced it as a user while playing your favorite video game or
  using online banking to pay your bills.\r\n\r\nThat’s annoying, isn’t it? Every
  time we give the application more and more memory, it seems never enough…\r\n\r\nIn
  Sonar we know how important it is to use memory efficiently. As our tools are often
  a part of your ci jobs, we care how much you spend on the infrastructure and try
  to minimize the cost.\r\n\r\nSo in this session, I will try to share some tips for
  investigating, fixing, and preventing potential memory leaks and reducing the memory
  footprint. In simple words, I will show how you can help your applications eat memory
  « healthier »."
