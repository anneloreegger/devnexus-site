title: Making the best of Jakarta EE, Kubernetes, WebSphere and the cloud with AI
description: This hands-on session will show you how to enable deployments of Jakarta
  EE applications using Open Liberty or WebSphere Liberty to the cloud with AI. Attendees
  will explore how to set up a Liberty deployment on Kubernetes, and how to streamline
  the containerization, deployment and provisioning of resources using AI. We’ll also
  cover how to establish a SQL Database connection to the deployed application. We’ll
  be using GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat to access generative AI, enabling smooth,
  secure deployments while saving time.  By the end, participants will have a comprehensive
  understanding of how to optimize, test, and deploy their Java applications on the
  cloud using Open/WebSphere Liberty and Kubernetes.
