title: My children will never deploy active-passive.
description: "Is your app alone and trembling in a dark, single-region with failures,
  latency, and retry storms closing in on every side?\r\n\r\nBuild a Spring Boot app
  with Spring Data Redis, deploy it to a single region backed by Azure Cache for Redis
  Enterprise (ACRE).  Add a global load balancer like Azure Front Door.  Deploy the
  same application to multiple regions, backed my multiple instances of ACRE connected
  in active-active configuration.  Learn why connecting to data in a different region
  is an anti-pattern. Demonstrate destroying an entire region to show the value of
  active-active level resilience. Using Terraform, Spring Boot and Azure.\r\n\r\nIn
  this session, you will learn a reference architecture, for modern, geo-distributed
  applications. You will learn how to modernize a single-region application, into
  a multiple-region or multi-cloud architecture. By the end of this interactive session,
  your apps will be able to shine bright with confidence, resiliency, and no more
  trembling."
