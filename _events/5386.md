A modern take on the basics of Kotlin Coroutines. We'll take a look at why we need them, what they are, how they work, and compare them with other approaches. We'll see how Kotlin Coroutines help you reliably manage asynchrony and concurrency without fear of memory leaks and lost exceptions, with type system guiding you to write the correct code.
