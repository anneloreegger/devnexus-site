title: Building Your Own Private GenAI Chatbot with Java Tools - A Step-by-Step Adventure
description: "In today's software development world, there are several Machine Learning
  (ML) tools that empower developers to create specific chatbots that cater to various
  needs. These chatbots harness the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) trained
  on confidential, private document sets on your local machine or enterprise data
  repositories. They enable you to interact and engage with these document sets, from
  summarizing emails and meeting notes to gauging sentiment, extracting dates and
  names from websites, pre-screening resumes, and performing many other tasks.\r\n\r\nBut
  most of these systems are Python-based.  While Python serves as a formidable language
  for ML, many software developers find themselves operating within the Java ecosystem,
  especially within large organizations that prioritize Java for robust and reliable
  production deployments. This presentation focuses on Java-centric tools to construct
  tuned assistant systems using the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique.\r\n\r\nQuick
  Overview of Neural Networks, Weights, and Embeddings\r\nExploring the Current State
  of LLMs\r\nImplementing Prompts and Completions via a Java API to ChatGPT\r\nUnderstanding
  Prompt Structure and Prompt Engineering Techniques\r\nLearn about Instruction-Tuning
  and Fine-Tuning Techniques\r\nNavigating Vector Databases and Embeddings with Java\r\nCrafting
  a Private Chatbot Architecture\r\nDemo\r\n"
