As a developer you are expected to know many different programming languages based on the problem domain.  There are specialized languages for system programming, user interfaces, relational queries, data science, and even cooking, but how well does your cloud infrastructure support these languages?  We will explore some of the trials and pitfalls with intermixing languages on modern cloud platforms when using advanced features like MicroService Orchestration, Functions as a Service, Digital Assistants, Container-based Deployment, Log Analysis, and Security Scanning.  Several awards will be issued including the highly prestigious “Brainf*ck as a Service” award.  Why should you have to deviate from your favorite programming language when the computers can do it for you?
