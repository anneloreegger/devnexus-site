Completable futures were introduced in Java 8, and they are a powerful mechanism to add concurrency (not parallelism) to your application logic. 

If you are a developer, you may make your code more performant by using CompletableFutures where it makes sense.

If you are a library developer, it may be a good thing to offer an API that returns CompletableFutures so that your users will be able to benefit from it.
