title: 'Refactoring AF (After Fowler): Some Large Refactoring Patterns'
description: "Martin Fowlerâ€™s Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code was
  first published in 1999. What have we learned since then about refactoring? What
  should we, as professional software developers, know before deciding to do a refactor
  on a legacy codebase? What is the thought process we need to apply when choosing
  a new design for existing code? This talk will delve into these questions with examples
  and humor.\r\n\r\nThe audience for this session is software developers and the people
  that interface with them (product owners, scrum masters, development managers) who
  need to know the value of this important and often neglected technical practice.\r\n\r\nAt
  the end of the session, the attendee will be able to plan a refactoring effort on
  legacy codebases, apply refactoring techniques beyond those listed in Fowler, and
  recognize accidental code complexity in large codebases."
