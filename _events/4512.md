This talk will explore some of the differentiating and compelling features that Elasticsearch offers using real-world use-cases as examples. I will share best practices in the use of Elasticsearch in processing Big Data in ETL, centralized logging, and data visualization. Iâ€™ll also cover deploying and tuning Elasticsearch for high transaction volumes, fast query response times, fast inserts, and fault-tolerance.
