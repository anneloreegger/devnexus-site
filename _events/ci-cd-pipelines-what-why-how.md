title: 'CI/CD Pipelines : What, Why, How?'
description: "To avoid getting caught up in notions of “the right tool” it is important
  to understand the core concepts of continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery
  or continuous deployment (CD). Choosing the right tool should be a consequence of
  defining the right goals, metrics and processes to automate. In this session we
  will explore common ideas that must be present in commercial and open source solutions
  to monitor, automate, verify and deliver software. \r\nFor example: Tasks, Steps,
  Runs, End-to-end automation, Workflows, Tool orchestration, Release cycles, among
  others. \r\n"
