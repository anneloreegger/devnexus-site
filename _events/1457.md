Spring Framework 5.0 provides a choice of two web stacks. One is the existing, Servlet API based, Spring MVC, and the other is the new, non-blocking, reactive API based Spring WebFlux. 

In this session we will review the range of choices, understand the architecture and execution models for each stack, and discuss how to make choices. The presentation includes slides and demo code.
