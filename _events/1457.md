Spring Framework 5.0 provides a choice of two web stacks. One is the existing, Servlet API based Spring MVC, and the other is the new, non-blocking, reactive Spring WebFlux. In this session we will review the choices, understand the architecture and execution model of each, demo some code, and discuss how to make choices.
