title: 'Say the Words:  Modern Java with JavaFX for Rich Client UIs'
description: "Wordle is a popular online game where you have up to six tries to guess
  a hidden five-letter word. By combining the power of the JavaFX UI toolkit with
  the latest Java Development Kit features, we show how to implement a version of
  Wordle for desktop and mobile devices (iOS and Android). \r\n\r\nLearn how to create
  the main UI layout with Scene Builder and use specialized UI controls with pseudo-classes
  for CSS styling. Understand JavaFX property binding to control UI state and use
  JavaFX animation for cool looking effects. We'll also use modern Java including
  lambdas, streams, method references, records, and enhanced switch expressions."
