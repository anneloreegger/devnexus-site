title: 'The Wild Westâ€¦East, North and South: Multi-Region Java Apps in the Cloud'
description: "Cloud providers allow us to provision our application infrastructure
  in cloud regions and availability zones around the world. This makes it possible
  to build Java apps that serve user requests with low latency from nearly anywhere.
  However, only a few deploy application instances across several distant locations.\r\n\r\nThis
  hands-on session introduces you to the design patterns of multi-region Java applications
  in the cloud with a focus on latency and response time. We'll start with a traditional
  single-region configuration and then switch to a multi-region setting. In the end,
  we'll have a working prototype of an application that handles user traffic with
  low latency in North America, Europe, and Australia."
