title: Using AI to Deploy Java apps to Kubernetes
description: 'Developer teams are constantly under pressure to deliver new features
  and functionality without impacting core applications, often using new and unfamiliar
  features and environments. In this session weâ€™ll show how to use AI to automate
  deployments to Kubernetes reliably and securely using GitHub actions.  Highlights
  will include using AI to create Kubernetes deployment manifests and GitHub actions,
  AB Testing, blue-green deployments, and GitHub repo features for Dev/Test environments,  plus  practical
  container orchestration for Kubernetes in production.  '
