Play is a powerful method to learn! Come and play some simple agile games that use playing cards, index cards and dice to explore the different values that are at the foundation of Agile and Lean development practices.  In addition to your own insights, you may be able to take these game back to work to share with your co-workers.

This is a hands-on session so come prepared to have some fun!

There is no "right" answer to what you're "supposed to" learn from a game, so come ready to discover your own insights into software development processes and teamwork.
