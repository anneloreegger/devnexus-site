title: Quarkus and AI. Integrating Java and LLM to build intelligent applications.
description: "A Large Language Model (LLM) is a component of artificial intelligence
  specifically designed to comprehend and generate text that closely resembles human
  language based on the input it receives. One common scenario where it finds utility
  is when it needs to generate Java code to address a problem or create Kubernetes
  manifests with specific features.\r\n\r\nHowever, LLMs can also be employed with
  your enterprise code to enhance the customer experience, eliminating the need for
  customers to navigate through an entire website or improving the search process
  of on-site documentation \r\n\r\nDuring this session, we will explore how to integrate
  Quarkus with Large Language Models to establish a novel interaction interface for
  your users so they feel more human than just clicking across links.\r\n\r\nIt's
  important to note that while Quarkus plays a significant role in this discussion,
  the concepts presented also apply to other Java frameworks.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested
  in hands-on experience with Large Language Models and Java, with a focus on practical
  applications rather than theory,  then this session is for you.\r\n"
