In this demos loaded talk we'll explore the best practices to create a Docker image for a Java app (it's 2019 and new comers such as Jib, CNCF buildpacks are interesting alternatives to Docker builds !) - and how to integrate best with the Kubernetes ecosystem : after explaining main Kubernetes objects and notions, we'll discuss Helm charts and productivity tools such as Skaffold, Draft and Telepresence.
