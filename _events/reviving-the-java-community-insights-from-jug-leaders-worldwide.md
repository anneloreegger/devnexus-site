title: 'Reviving the Java Community: Insights from JUG Leaders Worldwide'
description: "In recent years, the Java Community has faced somewhat of a paradox.
  While Java technology itself has grown and the number of online resources has skyrocketed,
  local Java User Groups (JUGs) have seen disruptions, with in-person meetings and
  activities coming to a halt, participation dropping, and even leaders losing interest.
  In this interactive session, we'll explore strategies to revive the community's
  spirit. So we can all embrace and celebrate Java's technical advancements.\r\n\r\nJoin
  us for an open conversation based on in-depth discussions with JUG leaders from
  around the world. We'll discuss their experiences, the challenges they've encountered,
  and the innovative solutions they've adopted. As we come together as a community,
  we'll address important questions: What role do leaders and organizations play in
  this revival? How can we collectively reenergize our local communities and celebrate
  the ongoing evolution of the Java ecosystem? This presentation aims to inspire action
  and motivate us all to revive this community we love.\r\n"
