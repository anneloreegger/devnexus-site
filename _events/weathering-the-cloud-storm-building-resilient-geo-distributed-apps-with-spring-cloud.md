title: 'Weathering the Cloud Storm: Building Resilient Geo-Distributed Apps with Spring
  Cloud'
description: "Cloud availability zones and regions are not immune to outages. The
  zones go down regularly and regions become unavailable during natural disasters
  or human-caused incidents. Thus, if an availability zone or a larger area goes down,
  so does your applicationâ€”unless the application can work across multiple geographic
  locations.\r\n\r\nCome and learn how to build resilient, geo-distributed Java apps
  that can withstand various cloud failures. Using Spring Cloud tools and components,
  you'll architect and deploy a geo-distributed Slack-like messenger that can span
  several continents, load balance requests across distant regions, and most importantly,
  tolerate various storms and outages in the cloud."
