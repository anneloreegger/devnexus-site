This session will walk attendees through a scoring formula and process that utilizes your existing tools and open source resources to help you better understand the quality of your code in pre-prod. Taking into account new errors, increasing errors, slowdowns and more, we will demonstrate how to pinpoint critical errors, and automatically block unstable releases in your CI/CD pipeline.
