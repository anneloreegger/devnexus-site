Letâ€™s face it, the pace at which we must deliver code is getting out of control. Business expects features yesterday, architecture expects everything to be modular and deployable in containers, and you spend half your day dealing with production issues (all hours of the day). There are only 24 hours in a day and it feels like you have to work 30 of them to keep from drowning. Is there any time for you to have a life? 

The good news is there is a better way. In this talk attendees will learn techniques for identifying new & critical issues before they get to production; and if they do get to production, how to quickly identify and resolve them before they become a Sev1. You will learn how to get your life back!
