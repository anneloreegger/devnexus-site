Most enterprise developers are familiar with cloud-native journeys with Kubernetes, Microservices, and the Cloud. With the desire to add intelligence to applications, we need to integrate AI/ML into our workflow and even create the machine learning models ourselves.

Join us in this session to discuss how you can bring AI/ML development closer to developers and IT professionals. We'll highlight the similarities and differences between AI/ML and application development workflows and show how you can implement both on top of Red Hat OpenShift using the tools and technologies developers already use and love.
