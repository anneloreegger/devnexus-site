Do you have a private project, an open-source tool or want to do a POC? Do you already have the idea in mind and you wish to get started? Are you looking for a suitable environment so that you get the best possible support for your development?
JFrog offers you just the right tools for this. You can get access to the JFrog Platform and use it freely. With Artifactory, Xray, Pipelines and more, you have a complete DevSecOps environment at your disposal.

In this workshop, you will be shown step by step how to set up, assemble, and use the individual components needed for a simple Java project with Maven.

You will learn the following:

How to set up and use repositories with appropriate permissions
How to set up a Continuous Integration pipeline that automatically runs unit tests and provides feedback on each push to your code repo
How to set up automatic security scanning for your project
How to set up a Continuous Delivery pipeline that will automatically deploy your project to a test environment in the cloud for the purposes of integration testing

By the end of this workshop, you will have been exposed to the full DevSecOps experience from development all the way to deployment and will be able to apply this knowledge to your future projects!
