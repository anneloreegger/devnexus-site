title: Spring off the HTTP High Dive into an Optimized Connection Pool
description: 'In this session, I will explore different Spring libraries used for
  HTTP calls like RestTemplate, WebClient, and RestClient-which is a new feature in
  Spring Framework 6.1.  I’ll then dive into the multitude of settings that are available
  along with what defaults are present when nothing is given, focusing in on connection
  pool settings.  I’ll use observability tools and logs to show what’s happening under
  the covers and showcase some gotchas for things like TTL settings and DNS caching. '
