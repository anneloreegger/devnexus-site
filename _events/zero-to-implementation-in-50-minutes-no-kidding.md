title: Zero to Implementation in 50 Minutes, No Kidding!
description: If you separate yourself from the distractions you typically see when
  analyzing business requirements you quickly realize that they are usually fairly
  simple. You may or may not have to consume some input. You may or may not have to
  produce some output. That is all! This means that implementing and testing the actual
  requirements should be significantly more straightforward than what most developers
  experience in real life. And then there is another set of distractions where many
  developers come up with a complete design of a solution to a requirement, now treating
  such a solution as a requirement. Without realizing that their design is not the
  requirement they miss out on the simpler and better solution.  What are those distractions,
  how to spot them, and how Spring can help you deal with them?
