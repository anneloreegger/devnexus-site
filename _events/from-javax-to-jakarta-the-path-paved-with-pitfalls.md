title: From javax to jakarta, the path paved with pitfalls
description: "The switch from javax to jakarta namespace is probably the biggest change
  in the Java ecosystem over the last 20 years. It does not only impact Java EE application
  servers, but all libraries, from Spring or Quarkus to TomEE. This presentation is
  about presenting the problem of migrating from javax to jakarta namespace. The pitfalls
  and challenges encountered based on a simple application example. We will go through
  the possible options and how best companies can switch.\r\n\r\nNow that we are in
  Jakarta, the platform is evolving very quickly and ignoring the challenge isnâ€™t
  a good bet.\r\n"
