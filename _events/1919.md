Humanity is turning its gaze beyond Earth orbit, seeking to become a multiworld species. NASA missions to Earth's moon, moons of Jupiter and Saturn and nearby asteroids are in development now. The complexities of the trajectory design for these missions present an overwhelming design space. The JavaFX based Deep Space Trajectory Explorer provides custom 2D/3D visualizations. Often the  design space however demands more computing power than available on a single system. Gluon's CloudLink provisioning provides a crucial yet elegant bridge to Oracle Cloud Platform and Bare Metal resources enabling mission success. Demonstration will include data related to manned Lunar surface excursion missions via the Deep Space Gateway.
