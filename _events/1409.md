When the Microprofile initiative was started in 2016, it only took about three months before version 1.0 was launched. From day one, there were four different implementations from four different vendors available.

One year later, Microprofile 1.1 is here!

Whereas version 1.0 was a subset of Java EE specifications, version 1.1 brings something new to the table. The new kid on the block is <i>MicroProfile Config</i>.

In this fast-paced, demo-heavy session, MicroProfile will be introduced and demonstrated using the available implementations in live coding demos. All implementations will be explored and compared in a vendor neutral way.

We will also take a look at the potential candidates for future versions. This will include technologies such as:

<ul>
   <li>Fault Tolerance</li>
   <li>Security</li>
   <li>Health Checks</li>
</ul>
