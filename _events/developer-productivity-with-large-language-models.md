title: Developer Productivity with Large Language Models
description: "The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has transformed how developers
  approach coding, offering new opportunities to improve productivity and collaboration.
  The combination of LLMs and Java offers a transformative opportunity to streamline
  workflows, enhance code quality, and reduce development cycles.\r\n\r\nThis session
  explores how LLMs, such as OpenAIâ€™s GPT and GitHub Copilot, can empower developers
  by automating repetitive coding tasks, improving debugging efficiency, and generating
  optimized, boilerplate-free code. We discuss practical applications of LLMs in Java
  development, including intelligent code generation, debugging assistance, and documentation
  creation. Additionally, we explore how LLMs can support the learning curve for new
  Java developers by providing real-time guidance and best practices. "
