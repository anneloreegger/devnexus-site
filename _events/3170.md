Ever wondered what makes a cloud-native application "cloud-native"? Ever wondered what the unique challenges are and how best to address them on fully-open Java technologies? In this workshop, you'll learn what it means to be cloud-native and how that impacts application development. You'll learn about Eclipse MicroProfile, an industry collaboration defining technologies for the development and management of cloud-native microservices. With a full set of MicroProfile workshop modules available to you, you'll be able to start with the basics of REST services and progress to more advanced topics, or you can jump right in and develop secure, fault tolerant, configurable and monitorable microservices.

Once you've developed your microservice, you'll learn how to package it in a Docker container and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster. Finally, you'll learn the role of a service mesh and use Istio to manage your microservice interactions.
