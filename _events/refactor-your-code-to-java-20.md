title: Refactor your code to Java 20
description: "All of a sudden Java is a hip language again. With every release, we
  get new features. But your code still looks like 2014 aka Java 1.8. Let’s change
  that and bring the new style to your codebase. In this session, we will take a look
  at “legacy” code and refactor it to gain the benefits of newer Java versions. In
  a live coding setting, Barry and Richard will present each other with refactoring
  quests to demonstrate how you can go about changing your code today.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:
  You might learn about features your colleagues don't want you to know because you
  won’t stop talking about new Java releases \U0001F609\r\n"
