The conflict between technical professionals and traditional managers is inevitable because each side wants different things. Most employees feel that when conflicts arise with their managers, their only options are either to go along with what the manager wants, or leave. Neither option gets you what you want when you want it. This talk, based on the book of the same name, discusses a third option: how to build a relationship over time that makes your boss want to keep you around and keep you happy. It includes how to push back when your manager makes decisions you don't like, how to provide good enough answers that build a constructive loyalty relationship, how to avoid common mistakes like believing your boss is actually your friend, and more.
