Serverless and FaaS are rapidly establishing themselves as fundamental cloud services. It's a radically simple model for deployment and management of code in the cloud.

As we willingly, happily sacrifice control over infrastructure and deployment, what else have we given up? The basics of FaaS seem pretty straightforward, but I think we need new knowledge, tools and techniques to make our FaaS apps really shine.
