As more applications are experiencing the benefits of using a reactive programming model, one of the biggest problems they experience is the mismatch between Reactive Stream back pressure and current networking protocols. The RSocket protocol enables Reactive Streams back pressure to be transmitted across a network link connecting reactive flows in multiple applications to directly affect one another in a positive way. In addition to introducing the RSocket protocol and how to use it, this talk will show integration with Spring Cloud Gateway and how it, combined with RSocket, can create a type of messaging gateway.
