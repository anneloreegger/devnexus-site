We all are familiar with SOLID and other software design principles and have explored many design patterns. There is no better way to get a deeper understanding than to practice the concepts. Furthermore, some of the principles and patterns minifest themselves in what appear to be rather unconventional ways when applied under a set of constraints and requirements. In this hands-on intensive workshop we will take some problems and device elegant lightweight design, in code, and discuss the tradeoffs. Come experience the evolution of ideas into code and take shape by way of incremental development.
