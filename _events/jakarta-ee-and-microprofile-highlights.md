title: Jakarta EE and MicroProfile Highlights
description: "Jakarta EE and MicroProfile are powerful platforms for developing applications
  and microservices. Attendees of this session will learn important features of Jakarta
  EE and MicroProfile through a number of examples, using a hands on approach, correlating
  usage of the APIs to real-life scenarios. The examples presented will showcase both
  established and recently released features of Jakarta EE 10 and MicroProfile 6.
  The focus will be on some of the most important features from a variety of specifications,
  ranging from Jakarta Faces to Jakarta WebSockets and MicroProfile Config. The demoâ€™s
  provide an overview of each, including how specifications complement each other.
  In order to run these examples, we will use server-side resources using Payara,
  and development of microservices with Payara Micro and Docker. \r\nAttendees will
  walk away with a solid understanding of some of the most important features of Jakarta
  EE and MicroProfile.\r\n"
