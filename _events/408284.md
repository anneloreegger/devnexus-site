title: 'Journey to cloud : leave no Java workload behind'
description: The shift towards cloud and container technologies is driving a number
  of innovations in the Java ecosystem. With the growing importance of startup time
  and memory footprint, features developed in the Eclipse OpenJ9 JVM like remote JIT
  servers and using CRIU to snapshot/restore Java applications are increasingly relevant
  for modern Java deployments. You may have read about or watched a talk about these
  exciting new technologies, but in this talk we're going to pull together the full
  landscape for you. We'll explain how snapshot/restore and JIT servers and all the
  other performance and footprint enhancements developed at OpenJ9 fit together as
  a compelling and cooperative solution to optimize Java for the cloud. Come to this
  talk to learn more about our vision and strategy for the future of Java performance,
  where no Java workload is left behind in the journey to the cloud.
