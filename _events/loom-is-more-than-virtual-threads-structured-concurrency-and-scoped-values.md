title: 'Loom is more than virtual threads: Structured Concurrency and Scoped Values'
description: 'Most of the talk about Project Loom as been about JEP 425: Virtual Threads.
  That''s great because virtual threads are incredibly useful and will revolutionize
  how we write high-throughput applications. But did you know there are two more JEPs
  associated with Project Loom that are also very useful? First we''ll learn about
  JEP 428: Structured Concurrency and how it will simplify multithreaded programming
  on the JVM. Next, we''ll learn about JEP 429: Scoped Values which aims to solve
  some problems that ThreadLocals have had since their introduction way back in Java
  1.2!  Come to this talk and we''ll learn why these projects are useful additions
  to the JVM, and write some code to illustrate where you''ll be able to use them
  effectively. '
