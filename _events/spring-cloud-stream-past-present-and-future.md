title: Spring Cloud Stream Past, Present, and Future.
description: Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for building highly scalable microservices
  connected to shared messaging systems. Together with Spring Cloud Function, Spring
  Cloud Task and other frameworks from the Spring Cloud portfolio, it is evolving
  and quickly becoming a go-to solution for users who want to spend more time concentrating
  on functional aspects of their microservices while guarding themselves from nonfunctional
  (boilerplate) concerns such as connectivity, integration, and many others. In this
  "state of the union" session (50/50 presentation/live-code), Glenn will discuss
  and demonstrate the current features, the recent changes and enhancements, and talk
  about what's coming in the future.
