The permeation of smart appliances and low size weight and power computing devices in our lives has increased the challenge of cyber security by making locations for network activity far less static. For operational centers this raises the need for an awareness of the physical domain in the same context as traditional network activity. To provide this situational awareness facilities have been outfitted with low-cost IoT devices (RaspPi, Xandem, ZWave) to capture these physical modalities. This presentation will discuss some of these sensors along with the data services (Kafka) that stream to endpoint consumers. Demonstration will show data management (Kibana, ElasticSearch) and a custom JavaFX visualization for all modalities.
