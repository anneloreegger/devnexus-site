title: 'Hands-on Workshop: Building Streaming Data Pipelines with Apache Kafka'
description: "Data is everywhere. It's being produced by almost everything around
  you. In order for businesses to be competitive, they need to build resilient, scalable
  systems that can efficiently tap into and react to this ever-increasing volume of
  data. \r\n\r\nEnter: streaming data pipelines. Apache Kafka is a distributed event
  streaming platform that allows you to move and transform data in real-time. Throughout
  this workshop, you’ll build up a solid foundation and understanding of Kafka, learning
  the basic building blocks of the technology, its components, as well as how to produce
  and consume data. From there, you’ll get hands-on experience ingesting data from
  external systems into Kafka using Kafka Connect, joining and transforming Kafka
  data in real-time with ksqlDB stream processing, and using Kafka Connect to move
  data to downstream systems.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the workshop, you'll understand
  the value of real-time data and have everything you need to start building your
  own streaming data pipeline.\r\n\r\nNote: This workshop will utilize a free Confluent
  Cloud account for hosting Kafka clusters, stream processing, and schema registry.
  Participants require some programming knowledge."
