After decades on the outskirts, Functional Programming is finally breaking into the mainstream due to changing needs and paradigms. For instance, Apache Spark has brought FP to many developers due to its function-oriented, big data transformation API. This session will give you a quick intro to FP. You’ll learn from code examples how to make sense of terminology like Higher-Order Function, Functor, and Monad – and you won’t need a math degree!
