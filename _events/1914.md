You may have heard of Clojure and are wondering what the hype is all about, or may even even have played with it, but you still don't see what the fuss is all about. Either way, if you are curious about Clojure, then this is the talk for you.

In this session we will explore some facets of Clojure the language - we will attempt to see what sets us apart from other languages on the JVM, and perhaps give you a few more reasons to both explore, and hopefully consider Clojure for your next home, or work project.
