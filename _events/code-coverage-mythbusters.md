title: Code coverage MythBusters
description: "Code coverage is a compelling set of metrics that can help you improve
  the quality of your software, prevent potential bugs, and even help you investigate
  the issues.\r\n\r\nAnd as we know with great power comes great responsibility. When
  applied in the wrong way code coverage can easily transform from your best friend
  that can boost a developer’s productivity into your worst enemy that throws the
  sand in the wheels of your developers' productivity machine.\r\n\r\nAfter many years
  of answering community questions about code coverage in the JaCoCo mailing list,
  StackOverflow, and in the Sonar community forum we learned that most software engineers
  don’t understand the purpose of code coverage and how to apply it correctly. \r\n\r\nIn
  this talk, we will dispel the most popular myths built around code coverage. This
  talk will help you understand the concept of code coverage, how it should be used,
  and how to boost your productivity with code coverage."
