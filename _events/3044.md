Building an API is easy. Designing an API is hard. That's the motto of Undisturbed REST: a guide to designing the perfect API, and the book used by many of today's top enterprises to answer key questions and build a sustainable, efficient API that lasts. In this session we'll jump right in, tackling the questions you need to answer, looking at how to design your API, and learning from real examples in the field. And as a special bonus, each participant will receive a complimentary PDF version of the book to dig in and continue learning with.
