Weather has an enormous economic impact on a day-to-day basis, beyond the billions of impacted caused by severe weather. Superior science requires precise measurement. Super computing and Artificial Intelligence are coming together to make high resolution weather forecasting possible, taking the resolution down 4x with Global High-Resolution Forecasting model. This session will talk about the value for tapping into better global weather data for adding value to applications, as well as where the future might take us with new high-resolution weather data and superior predictive insights. GRAF brings more exact weather forecasting to places where previously there wasn't the capability, and that will have impact from crop yield all the way to plane routes.
