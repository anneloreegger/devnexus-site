title: API Toolbox with Spring
description: "Have you ever wondered what options are available in the Spring ecosystem
  to help developers define and build APIs? What protocols and serialization libraries
  are supported?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will go over what options are available to
  Spring Developers to build APIs. We will cover traditional HTTP APIs as well as
  alternative protocols for messaging and streaming APIs. We will introduce other
  projects from the Spring portfolio such as Spring Data and Spring Cloud that can
  enhance developer productivity in creating APIs and developer experience while consuming
  them."
