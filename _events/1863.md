With Java supporting lambda expressions, we have nothing to stop us from creating functional style of code for our day to day applications. We are so used to object-oriented programming, but remember the paradigm shift we went through to adapt to that way of programming. It is yet another paradigm shift and most of us wonder how in the world can we write functional style code. Much like how OO was not as much about the syntax as it was about the design, functional programming is about the design, the idioms, and the data structures we would use to program.

In this hands-on workshop, we will learn about functional programming using practical examples, create small apps that will make use of this style of programming, and relate to how it differs from the traditional way were used to and the benefits it offers.
