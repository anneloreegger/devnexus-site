title: Functional Programming with Java 8 and 9
abstract: "With Java supporting lambda expressions, we have nothing to stop us from
  creating functional style of code for our day to day applications. We are so used
  to object-oriented programming, but remember the paradigm shift we went through
  to adapt to that way of programming. It is yet another paradigm shift and most of
  us wonder how in the world can we write functional style code. Much like how OO
  was not as much about the syntax as it was about the design, functional programming
  is about the design, the idioms, and the data structures we would use to program.\r\n\r\nIn
  this hands-on workshop, we will learn about functional programming using practical
  examples, create small apps that will make use of this style of programming, and
  relate to how it differs from the traditional way were used to and the benefits
  it offers."
