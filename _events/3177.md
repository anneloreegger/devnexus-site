In four short years, GraphQL has taken the API world by storm. You may heard about this technology and wondered what all the fuss is about; wonder no longer. We’ll start at the very beginning: what is GraphQL and what it can to to you. We’ll move on to brass tacks: developing a schema, implementing a server, and writing client queries. We’ll also touch on some of the many graphql tools and clients that have sprung up. By the end of the presentation, you’ll be able to start writing your own GraphQL servers and clients!
