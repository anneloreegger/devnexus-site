title: Going Beyond Test-Driven Development
description: "Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a simple three-step practice, and its
  practitioners regularly deliver higher-quality code in less time. So why aren't
  we all doing it? Unfortunately, most programmers find it difficult to adopt the
  TDD process as it is usually taught. But, what if there was an easier way?\r\nIn
  this session, you will learn how to avoid the limitations caused by the way TDD
  is usually taught, and how to avoid the most common problems developers have with
  writing automated tests. You will also learn how to leverage the process to minimize
  the time you spend debugging -- which leaves you with more time for the fun parts."
