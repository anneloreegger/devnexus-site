Join us as we walk through setting up a Kubernetes (k8s) cluster of raspberry pis.  In this talk, we will show you how to make sure your operating system is ready for installation.  We will tackle problems encountered with network plugin installation and work around k8s issues. Once we have a working cluster, we will show you where to find ARM images and also how to build your own. We will top things off by deploying a working application using k8s
