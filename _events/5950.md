Gene Kim, Dr. Stephen Magill, and I studied 60,000 software dev teams to discover which practices made them exemplary.  I'll share the results about team size, adoption rates, release frequency, cybersecurity practices, and more that fundamentally changed our understanding of high quality, secure software development. Iâ€™ll then point to where our ground-breaking research transforms development forever: when ML and AI meet machines that can code.
