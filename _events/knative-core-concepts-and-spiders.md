title: Knative Core Concepts! And Spiders!
description: "Although Knative has been community-maintained since 2018, there has
  been buzz around the project lately because Knative has recently been accepted to
  the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as an incubating project.\r\n\r\nCool!
  But what is Knative, exactly?\r\n\r\nSimply put, Knative is a technology that streamlines
  and enhances the way that applications run on Kubernetes.\r\n\r\nThis talk is for
  people who are excited about this value proposition and want to dig deeper. How
  does it work? What components are at play? In what ways is running an app on Knative
  superior to running it directly on Kubernetes?\r\n\r\nInstead of presenting slides,
  Whitney will diagram the fundamental concepts of Knative, explaining how they work
  in simple, relatable terms. She will then drive deeper understanding with a live
  coding demo that gives context to the main points. With spiders and rainbows. You
  know, a real-life, straightforward, run-of-the-mill use case.\r\n\r\nAttend this
  talk to gain a high-level understanding of Knative, its main components, and how
  it simplifies and improves the way that apps run on Kubernetes."
