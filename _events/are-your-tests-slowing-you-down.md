title: Are Your Tests Slowing You Down?
description: "Testing is a Good Thing, right? Especially automated testing. But \"Good
  things come to those who wait\" is not something that's going to appeal to the busy
  developer. You want results, and you want them now. You're in The Zone working on
  a problem, and the last thing you want is to break your flow wrestling with your
  testing framework or waiting for the tests to finish running.\r\n\r\nMore code means
  more tests. More coverage means more tests. More tests mean more time. Time that
  you want to spend being productive, creative, innovative. How can you balance the
  need for quality with the need for speed?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Trisha will identify
  issues that slow down developers when writing, running and debugging tests, and
  look at tools that can help developers with each of these problems. There will be
  live coding, analysis of social media poll results, an overview of solutions in
  this space, \"best practice\" recommendations, and machine learning will be mentioned
  at some point."
