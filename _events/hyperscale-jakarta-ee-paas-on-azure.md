title: Hyperscale Jakarta EE PaaS on Azure
description: "Azure is the only top tier public cloud with a fully managed Jakarta
  EE service - JBoss EAP on App Service. \r\n\r\nIn this fast-faced, demo-heavy, and
  mostly slide-free session we will show first-hand how to run Jakarta EE on Azure
  using JBoss EAP on App Service. We will demo in real time how to stand up an instance
  very quickly and deploy a realistic Jakarta EE application that integrates with
  some services on the cloud such as database, directory server, cache or log aggregator.
  We will also see how things like load-balancing, automatic redeployment, auto-scaling,
  and monitoring work in a hyperscale PaaS.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the session, you
  will have all the demos available on GitHub so you can explore them on your own!"
