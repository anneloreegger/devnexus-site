title: 'Building Scalable Systems and Services with Spring Boot 3.4 '
description: "Hi, Spring fans! In this installment we're going to look at how to build
  scalable systems and services using the amazing Spring Boot 3.4 release and all
  the umbrella projects that accompany it. \r\n\r\nWe'll look at the basics - a sort
  of desk check for the wayward Spring developer - to ensure that development itself
  is scalable when using Spring.\r\n\r\nWe'll look at the basics of data access and
  web programming with Spring. We'll look at data processing strategies, too.\r\n\r\nWe'll
  look at how to build modular, intelligent applications with Spring Modulith and
  Spring AI. \r\n\r\nWe'll look at how to build messaging and integration into our
  system. \r\n\r\nWe'll look at how to integrate security into the system, making
  passwords safe and then - ideally - avoiding them altogether. \r\n\r\nAnd we'll
  look at scaling and optimizing Spring applications, too. \r\n\r\nProduction is the
  happiest place on earth! Join me for this workshop and we'll learn how to get there
  with aplomb. "
