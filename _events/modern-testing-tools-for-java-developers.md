title: Modern Testing Tools for Java Developers
description: "New versions of the API framework appear, adding the last trending and
  here we go again: changing our code to adopt these new things. How awesome it is!
  We are improving!\r\n\r\nHow about one of the most important and, sometimes, missed
  things: quality! How the quality evolves within the adoption of new versions of
  development frameworks and libraries?\r\n\r\nThis talk will show you 5 libraries
  you can use, as a Java Developer, to improve the application quality with real-world
  examples.\r\n\r\nAssertJ will give you infinity assertion possibilities compared
  to JUnit internals and Hamcrest matches, enabling you to easily use any kind of
  assertion, even creating your own.\r\n\r\nYou will learn how to use these tools
  with real-world examples!\r\n\r\nPiTest will increase, even more, the coverage of
  your tests by applying the mutation testing technique and creating bullet-proof
  unit tests.\r\n\r\nRestAssured will take your API tests to the next level where,
  using it as a \"hard user\", can ease the test creation based on an OpenAPI specification.\r\n\r\nAwaitability
  will solve one of the biggest problems in the API tests: asynchronous calls/messages
  (mainly in a messaging system). We will be able to wait for the request to be completed
  to assert any result.\r\n\r\nWiremock will give you the ability not only restricted
  as a mock solution for your unit and integration test but as a service virtualization
  tool solving common problems in an integrated environment."
