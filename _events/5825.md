Microservices and all other forms of distributed systems leave you in charge of dealing with consistency yourself. ACID transactions are only available locally within the service and protocols like two-phase commit donâ€™t scale. Many projects now either risk adventurous inconsistencies or write a lot of code for consistency management in the application layer.

In this talk I discuss these problems and go over solution approaches, including the Saga-Pattern. I will discuss recipes, patterns and frameworks that allow you to manage the right level of consistency but concentrate on the business logic. Expect fun little live hacking sessions with open source components like Camunda, but also real-life stories.
