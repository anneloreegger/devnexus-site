title: Mastering Modern Concurrency in Java - A Comprehensive Deep Dive with Virtual
  Threads
description: "Traditional methods of handling multiple tasks in Java have limitations,
  such as resource-heavy threads and complex code. These limitations can hinder performance
  and development speed in today's world, where fast, efficient applications are a
  must.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis session aims to introduce and demystify the latest Java 21
  concurrency featuresâ€”Virtual Threads, Structured Concurrency, Scoped Values. These
  tools can help you build faster, more efficient applications while keeping your
  code clean and manageable.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe'll deep-dive into each of these four topics
  through a blend of theory and practical code examples. You'll learn how to:\r\n-
  Utilize Virtual Threads for efficient multitasking\r\n- Implement Structured Concurrency
  for more readable and maintainable code\r\n- Leverage Scoped Values for smarter
  data sharing\r\n- Understand the continued relevance of Reactive Java in this new
  landscape\r\n\r\nWhether you're a seasoned developer or an architect, this session
  will equip you with the knowledge and skills to implement these modern features
  effectively. \r\n\r\nJoin me and take the first step towards mastering the future
  of Java concurrency!"
