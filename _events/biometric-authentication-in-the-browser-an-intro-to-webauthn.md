title: 'Biometric authentication in the browser: an intro to WebAuthn'
description: "WebAuthn is a standard which allows you to leverage biometric based
  authentication methods from within your browser. While you can use a variety of
  hardware to authenticate users, the real benefit of WebAuthn is the fact that it
  connects users’ browsers to built-in operating system authentication methods.\r\n\r\nWhen
  you build with WebAuthn, you are benefiting from the security and pervasiveness
  of FaceID, Fingerprint Scanner, and Windows Hello, among others. WebAuthn is supported
  by all major browsers, as well as all major desktop and mobile OS platforms.\r\n\r\nIn
  this talk, we’ll walk through the WebAuthn process, including registration, attestation,
  and authentication. You’ll learn the difference between platform and cross-platform
  authenticators, as well as the difference between user verification and user presence.\r\n\r\nAt
  the end of this talk, you’ll have a grasp of what WebAuthn is, when it makes sense,
  and how you can leverage it for your next project."
