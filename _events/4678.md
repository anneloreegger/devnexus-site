Itâ€™s a cool idea - decouple the client from the server and let the application tell the client what it can do dynamically. This approach should allow much more flexibility and resilience as the client and server can evolve separately. Unfortunately, the HATEOAS approach can be a free lunch for cybercriminals unless you understand the simple steps needed to secure your design.
