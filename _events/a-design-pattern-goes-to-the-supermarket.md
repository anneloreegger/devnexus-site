title: A design pattern goes to the supermarket
description: "Everybody knows the term design patterns. Some know the patterns and
  correct implementation by heart. Others vaguely recognize the pattern names but
  don’t recall the details. This talk is intended for the latter group. \r\n\r\nI’ll
  dive into a couple of design patterns using real-life examples. What would a design
  pattern look like in day-to-day life? We’ll follow Bobby and Billie and discover
  how a design pattern would behave in a non-digital environment: the supermarket!
  With the help of drawings and code snippets, this talk will give you a solid understanding
  of design patterns, so you won't have to look them up ever again!"
