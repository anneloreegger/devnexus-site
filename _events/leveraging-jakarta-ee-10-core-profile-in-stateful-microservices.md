title: Leveraging Jakarta EE 10 Core Profile in Stateful Microservices
description: Integration of Jakarta EE 10 Core Profile -compatible microservices frameworks
  with in-memory data grids creates a powerful platform for productive development
  and scalable operation of modern microservice architectures.  Developers benefit
  from Map-based persistence APIs injected into RESTful services, while the resulting
  architecture exhibits elastic scalability in cloud-native deployments.  This session
  will explore such an integration with Helidon 4 and Coherence CE,  and highlight
  state-of-the-art applications achieved as a result.  Java 21 virtual threads and
  MicroProfile 6 are also implemented in this integration. Join us to learn how the
  Jakarta EE platform can power your next cloud-native stateful microservices system.
