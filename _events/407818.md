title: Walking to School in the Snow or What to Do When You Aren't Building Bridges
  with Bricks
description: "Roman architects and engineers built colosseums, bridges and aqueducts
  that have lasted for millennia.  Most software applications lastâ€¦ not as long.\r\n\r\nThe
  discipline and processes of software engineering are continuously evolving to deliver
  faster results.  Meanwhile application architecture is undergoing a paradigm shift
  as the enterprise embraces the cloud.\r\n\r\nWhat does engineering discipline look
  like when time to market is more important than time in existence?  \r\n\r\nThis
  talk looks at 5 emerging architecture trends geared towards delivering business
  value faster and what these trends mean for developers:\r\n\r\n* Putting Architects
  in the Elevators\r\n* Composable Organizations\r\n* Product vs. Project Thinking\r\n*
  Paved Roads and Golden Paths\r\n* Data Meshes\r\n"
