title: 'Thriving in the cloud: Going beyond the 12 factors'
description: "Enabling applications to really thrive (and not just survive) in cloud
  environments can be challenging. The original 12 factor app methodology helped to
  lay out some of the key characteristics needed for cloud-native applications...
  but... as our cloud infrastructure and tooling has progressed, so too have these
  factors.\r\nIn this session we'll dive into the extended and updated 15 factors
  needed to build cloud native applications that are able to thrive in this environment,
  and we'll take a look at open source technologies and tools that can help us achieve
  this."
