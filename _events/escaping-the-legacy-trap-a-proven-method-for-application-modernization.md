title: Escaping the Legacy Trap - a proven method for application modernization
description: You're facing a big, multi-year re-write of your core applications. How
  do you start? This talk will explain one method used by large organizations, SWIFT.
  Sadly, older applications and services too often slow down and stop business innovation.
  Yet, 76% of executives said they are too invested in legacy applications to change.
  They’re caught in the legacy trap! Organizations simply can’t figure out how to
  prioritize this invisible work over adding new features and apps. But today, there’s
  no room to avoid modernizing core systems if your business wants to keep up. No
  more new features can be added to software and no more progress can be made on transformation
  journeys until this fear is faced. Come hear how people are escaping the legacy
  trap. This talk is based on the book by Coté and Marc Zotter, The Legacy Trap.
