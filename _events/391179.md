title: Service Mesh for Java Developers
description: "Service Mesh is the future of application connectivity. It delivers
  immediate value to any architecture by increasing our application traffic's security,
  reliability, and observability. \r\n\r\nIt abstracts the underlying network details
  and provides discovery, routing, and a variety of other functionality.\r\n\r\nIn
  this service mesh presentation, Viktor will show you how easy it is to get started
  (in Kubernetes) - how to install a control plane, deploy a JVM-based demo application
  (using popular java frameworks like spring boot, micronaut, etc), enable traffic
  policies, and touch on observability."
