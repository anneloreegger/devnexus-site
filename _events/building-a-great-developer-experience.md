title: Building a Great Developer Experience
description: If you want to onboard developers quickly, and retain them by providing
  a frustration-free environment, you need a great developer experience (DX). This
  goes beyond just providing CI/CD. It requires runtime libraries, build tooling,
  local environmets, data collection and displays, and migration automation. All of
  these work together to create a constant two-way stream of information between the
  platform engineers and their client development teams.
