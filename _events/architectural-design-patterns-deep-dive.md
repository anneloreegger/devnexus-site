title: Architectural Design Patterns Deep Dive
description: "In this day-long work workshop, we will review a catalog of all the
  standard architectural design patterns. For each design pattern, we will run docker-compose
  files that demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of those design patterns. So,
  you have a first-hand, full-on, and highly engaged full-day workshop to give you
  the knowledge you need to make critical architectural choices.\r\n\r\nAll labs and
  examples will be using docker-compose. The examples that we will be focusing on
  in this intensive workshop include:\r\n\r\n* Hexagonal Architecture\r\n* Domain
  Driven Design\r\n* Circuit Breaker\r\n* Retry\r\n* Bulkhead\r\n* Ambassador\r\n*
  Event Sourcing\r\n* Competing Consumers\r\n* Claim Check\r\n* Materialized Views\r\n*
  CQRS (Command-Query Responsibility Segregation)\r\n* Strangler Fig\r\n* Gatekeeper\r\n*
  Valet Key\r\n* Saga Pattern\r\n* Data Mesh"
