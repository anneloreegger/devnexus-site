title: The Art of Vulnerability Disclosure
description: Properly disclosing a vulnerability you found on a website, open source
  project, or app is not an easy task, especially not the first time. There are a
  lot of things to pay attention to and that can go wrong. But if done properly, it
  can be very rewarding, as most companies are very grateful. Whether you want to
  learn how to disclose your first vulnerability in the easiest way possible, or you
  want to hear about best practices and suggestions on what to do when things do not
  go as planned, this talk is for you.
