Besides managing the all-remote team from around the world, Gant has become a published author, adjunct professor, volunteer mentor, and a speaker at conferences worldwide.\r\n \r\n\r\nEach day, Gant refines what motivation and leadership mean as he strives to bridge the gap the theory and the concrete.  He voraciously consumes self-help books and online lectures, which he incorporates into his everyday processes.  Focus on personal enthusiasm and motivation to lead projects, workshops, and teams are the bedrock of success.  He refines these skills as often as possible at his local Toastmasters clubs, where he serves as Division Director.",
