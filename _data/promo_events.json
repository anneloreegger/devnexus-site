Following the publication of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development in 2001, teams have abandoned UML, discarded the concept of modelling and instead place a heavy reliance on conversations centered around incoherent whiteboard diagrams or shallow \"Marketecture\" diagrams created with Visio. Moving fast and being agile requires good communication, yet software development teams struggle with this fundamental skill. A good set of software architecture diagrams are priceless for aligning a team around a shared vision and for getting new-joiners productive fast.\r\n\r\nThis hands-on workshop explores the visual communication of software architecture and is based upon a decade of my experiences working with software development teams large and small across the globe. We'll look at what is commonplace today, the importance of creating a shared vocabulary, diagram notation, and the value of creating a lightweight model to describe your software system. The workshop is based upon the \"C4 model\", which I created as a way to help software development teams describe and communicate software architecture, both during up-front design sessions and when retrospectively documenting an existing codebase. It's a way to create maps of your code, at various levels of detail. Static structure, runtime and deployment diagrams are all covered, so you'll be able to tell different stories to different audiences. We'll wrap up the day by looking at the tooling landscape and diagram automation to keep your diagrams in sync with your source code.","track":"workshop","trackid":82,"type":"workshop","persons":[{"id":1041,"full_public_name":"Simon Brown","abstract":"Simon is an independent consultant specialising in software architecture, and the author of\r\n                        <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/b/software-architecture\">\"Software Architecture for Developers\"</a>\r\n                        (a developer-friendly guide to software architecture, technical leadership and the balance with agility).\r\n                        He is also the creator of the <a href=\"https://c4model.com\">C4 software architecture model</a>,\r\n                        which is a simple approach to creating maps of your code.

When upgrading a set of applications, Skipper only upgrades the applications that have changed and rolls out the new applications based on a customizable upgrade strategy.  Skipper also maintains custom application metadata of deployed applications that can be used to support operational dashboards.  \r\n\r\nIn this talk, you will learn how to build continuous delivery pipelines using existing CI products and application repositories by adding Skipper.  We will demonstrate how to take applications through initial deployment to QA, promotion to production, and rolling back across multiple cloud platforms.\r\n","track":"Cloud","trackid":65,"type":"lecture","persons":[{"id":975,"full_public_name":"Mark Pollack","abstract":"Mark Pollack is a software engineer with Pivotal and is the co-lead of the Spring Cloud Data Flow and Spring XD projects He has been a contributor to many Spring projects dating back to the Spring Framework in 2003 as well as founding the Spring.NET and Spring Data projects","avatar_path":null,"twitter_name":"@markpollack","tshirt_size":"Male XL","email":"mpollack@pivotal.io"}]},{"id":1707,"title":"Welcome to JUnit 5","abstract":"After more than a decade of waiting JUnit 5 is here!
