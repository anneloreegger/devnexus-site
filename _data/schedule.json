When you can more easily secure, upgrade, move, or modernize your code, that means you can adapt quickly and efficiently to changes in technology and markets. That’s what Migration Engineering is all about—and what we’ll be exploring in this workshop.\r\n\r\nWe’ll discuss and demonstrate how to create custom recipes using OpenRewrite, an open source auto-refactoring tool that enables large-scale code analysis and transformations. You’ll learn the make-up of recipes as we walk through a number of examples, then we’ll demonstrate how to write code search and transformation actions that are custom to your organization. We will assemble these recipes with the visitor pattern, and show how to stitch recipes together with YAML, with Refaster-style templates, with Semgrep matchers, etc. We’ll also show how Generative AI can be applied to accelerate recipe development. \r\n\r\nThis is a comprehensive look at all kinds of recipe development that will enable you to come away fully equipped to plan and exercise large-scale code transformations in your organization.",

When you can more easily secure, upgrade, move, or modernize your code, that means you can adapt quickly and efficiently to changes in technology and markets. That’s what Migration Engineering is all about—and what we’ll be exploring in this workshop.\r\n\r\nWe’ll discuss and demonstrate how to create custom recipes using OpenRewrite, an open source auto-refactoring tool that enables large-scale code analysis and transformations. You’ll learn the make-up of recipes as we walk through a number of examples, then we’ll demonstrate how to write code search and transformation actions that are custom to your organization. We will assemble these recipes with the visitor pattern, and show how to stitch recipes together with YAML, with Refaster-style templates, with Semgrep matchers, etc. We’ll also show how Generative AI can be applied to accelerate recipe development. \r\n\r\nThis is a comprehensive look at all kinds of recipe development that will enable you to come away fully equipped to plan and exercise large-scale code transformations in your organization.",

Long Live Developer Experience!\r\n\r\nIn this keynote style session, we’ll take a detailed, granular look at the barriers to productivity faced by developers today. 10x developers may be a myth, but 10x organizations are very real, as proven by the influential study performed in the 1980s, ‘The Coding War Games.’\r\n\r\nRight now, here in early 2024, we seem to be experiencing YAPP (Yet Another Productivity Philosophy), and that philosophy is converging on developer experience or ‘DevEx.’ It seems that with every new method we invent for the delivery of products, whether physical or virtual, we reinvent productivity productivity philosophies to go alongside them.\r\n\r\nWe have no need to reinvent another productivity approach when effective solutions such as internal developer portals already exist. As business leaders, we just need to invest in and create urgency behind these solutions today, so that we don’t find ourselves having the same discussion again in a decade.\r\n",

            "description": "According to researchers, a staggering 75% of enterprise software engineers will harness the power of AI code assistants by 2028. This shift will revolutionize not just how we write code but also the very essence of agile software development.\r\n\r\nAgile, a methodology born over 20 years ago, was crafted for a different era with its own unique challenges. While some principles remain timeless, others demand a fresh perspective in the age of AI-native development. Do we still need sprints when AI can prioritize tasks in real-time? And what happens to cross-functional teams when virtual specialists are at our fingertips?\r\n\r\nJoin Sven as he explores the evolving role of developers and the necessity to rethink human-to-human interaction in a world where AI is our primary coding companion. One thing is certain: we must recalibrate our collaboration strategies within software teams.",

These are useful for having high-level conversations, but they don't cover the internal implementation details of your Java app. You consider creating a C4 component diagram. Unfortunately the size and complexity of your Java codebase makes manually drawing this out of the question, and reverse-engineering the codebase with a generic tool produces a cluttered diagram that literally shows everything. How do you create useful component level diagrams that remain up to date with minimal effort? Is this even possible?\r\n\r\nJoin me for a discussion of how to tackle this problem, where I'll cover the theory and tactics behind how to reverse-engineer meaningful component diagrams, before presenting a live demo of how to use the open source Structurizr DSL to put the techniques into action.",

            "description": "Generative AI can be a force multiplier for developers, but it also comes with limitations. Developers are expected to co-create with AI, and check the generated output, or risk hallucinations running wild. This can aid development at a local machine, but what happens when you try to apply these tools on a massive scale?\r\n\r\nFor mass-scale code operations, AI needs to have agency, able to operate with some degree of autonomy. In this session, we’ll cover how you can use use techniques such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG), the richest code data source for Java called the lossless semantic tree (LST), and OpenRewrite rules-based recipes to drive more efficient and accurate AI model output for refactoring and analyzing large codebases.\r\n\r\nWe’ll specifically address how you can use AI embeddings as a powerful tool to visualize, analyze, and even do smarter sampling for your codebase. We’ll demonstrate using embeddings to perform searches, cluster data, get a birds-eye view of your codebase, as well as diagnose issues and recommend OpenRewrite recipes to fix the problem. We'll also show you how GenAI can be helpful at scale: by assisting with writing OpenRewrite deterministic recipes.\r\n\r\nCome learn the technical underpinnings for reliably using AI at scale for code modernization.",

This talk introduces GraphRAG, an innovative framework that integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with LLMs to address these issues. By leveraging the rich, structured data from KGs, GraphRAG refines LLM outputs, providing a robust context that enhances the precision of generated information. This integration not only improves the factual accuracy of responses but also significantly boosts model interpretability. We will demonstrate how GraphRAG utilizes the interconnected nature of KGs to ground LLMs in real-world knowledge, allowing for more reliable and transparent AI systems. Through practical examples and performance evaluations, attendees will see how this approach mitigates common limitations of traditional LLMs, such as ambiguity and information gaps. The session will highlight advancements in both the effectiveness and clarity of AI responses, showcasing the transformative impact of combining Graph Technology with LLMs. Join us to explore how GraphRAG is setting a new standard in enhancing AI's accuracy and explainability.",

Does that mean we need to drop everything we’ve built and become data scientists instead now?\r\n\r\nFortunately, we can infuse AI models built by actual AI experts into our applications fairly straightforwardly, thanks to some new projects. We promise it’s not as complicated as you might think! Thanks to the ease of use and superb developer experience of Quarkus and the nice AI integration capabilities that the LangChain4j libraries offer, it becomes trivial to start working with AI and make your stakeholders happy :)\r\n\r\nIn this session, you’ll explore a variety of AI capabilities. We’ll start from the Quarkus DevUI where you can try out AI models even before writing any code. Then we’ll get our hands dirty with some code and exploring LangChain4j features such as prompting, chaining, and preserving state; agents and function-calling; enriching your AI model’s knowledge with your documents using retrieval augmented generation (RAG); and discovering ways to run (and train) models locally using tools like Ollama and/or Podman AI Lab. In addition, we’ll look at the AI integration's observability and fault tolerance and compile the app to a native binary. Maybe we’ll even try some new features, such as generating images or audio!\r\n\r\nCome to this session to learn how to build AI-infused applications in Java from the actual Quarkus experts and engineers working on the Quarkus LangChain4j extensions. This is also an opportunity to provide feedback to the maintainers of these projects and contribute back to the community.",

So how can we bring the ease and speed of unit tests into these integration tests? Ideally, we’d like to use a local setup where we can quickly spin up and deploy our services in an emulated environment that’s as close as possible to the real deal. By simulating real-world scenarios and testing the integration of various parts of the system, these tests help us identify and resolve issues early in the development process. This is where Testcontainers and LocalStack work beautifully together to bring you the best of integration tests and cloud services on your machine. We’ll explore how we can enhance the testability of a Spring Boot application that relies on AWS services and vastly increase the test coverage of our applications without any need for mocking or remote AWS sandbox accounts.\r\n\r\nTesting your AWS-powered Spring Boot app with LocalStack and Testcontainers conveys isolation, speed, cost, and flexibility, making it effortless to get started with writing integration tests for your cloud application.",

            "description": "Java bytecodes and class files deliver on the original vision of “write once, run anywhere”.  Using a Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler allows JVM-based applications to compile only the code that’s being used frequently and optimise it precisely for how it is being used.  Using techniques like speculative optimisation can often deliver better performance than static, Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compiled code.\r\n\r\nHowever, this flexibility and performance comes at a cost.  Each time the JVM starts an application, it must perform the same analysis to find hot spots of code and compile them.  This is referred to as the application warmup time.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll look at several approaches to how this problem can be alleviated or even eliminated.  Specifically:\r\n\r\n•\tGenerating a JIT compiler profile of a running, warmed-up application that can be reused when the same application is restarted, eliminating the need for much of the JIT compilation.\r\n•\tOpenJDK Project Leyden's ahead-of-time class loading, method profiling and code compilation.\r\n•\tDecoupling the JIT compiler from the JVM for a Cloud environment.  Providing a centralised JIT-as-a-Service allows caching of compiled code and offloading the compilation work when new code must be compiled.\r\n•\tCreating a checkpoint of a running application.  This includes all application state (heap, stack, etc.) in addition to the JIT-compiled code.  Project CRaC will be used as an example.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the session, you’ll be all set to keep your Java hot!\r\n",

Reluctance to refactor increases the cost of development. However, refactoring for the sake of doing so can lead to greater productivity loss as well.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will use data driven approach. We will take examples of code, measure code quality, and then use automated code transformation tools to refactor the code, and then, once again, measure the quality of code and see how much we have improved. This can help us to not only refactor faster but also see the benefits realized and motivate us to move faster with greater efficiency.",

We'll begin with Ahead-of-Time (AOT) processing, which accelerates startup times by precomputing application configurations, followed by Class Data Sharing (CDS), which reduces memory usage by allowing JVM processes to share class metadata.\r\n\r\nWe’ll dive into GraalVM native images, highlighting how they drastically improve startup performance and memory consumption, making them ideal for modern cloud-native applications. We’ll also cover Project CRAC (Coordinated Restore at Checkpoint), a game-changer for reducing startup times in containerized environments by allowing JVM applications to be suspended and restored with minimal overhead.\r\n\r\nFinally, we'll wrap up with the integration of Java 21's virtual threads, a revolutionary improvement in how Spring Boot handles high-concurrency tasks, greatly enhancing scalability and efficiency. Through live demos, you'll learn how to leverage these tools and techniques to optimize your Spring Boot applications for maximum runtime performance.",

However, working with native code has traditionally been difficult on the Java platform. One had to contend with the boiler plate of writing JNI code in order to interact with native libraries. And it only got worse when trying to use native types, like structures, that have no java equivalent. Project Panama solves all these issues by introducing an FFI and Memory Access APIs that lets Java developers’ interop with native code seamlessly. Come to this session to learn more about how OpenJDK Project Panama can help you interact with native libraries seamlessly.",

            "description": "We rely heavily on polymorphism when programming with the object-oriented paradigm. That has served us really well, especially to create extensible code. However, like any tool and technique, there are times when that may not be the right choice. Java now provides an alternative that is useful in those select situations—the data-oriented programming.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will start with an example where the highly useful object hierarchy and polymorphism appears as a misfit and discuss how data-oriented programming solves the problem more elegantly. Get a good understanding of when to use each one of these and how to intermix them in your applications.",

Also, how do you debug the application? How do you even view the logs?  How do you securely build a container?\r\n\r\nIf this experience resonates with you, then this session is for you. \r\n\r\nIn this session, we show you a variety of tools and techniques that turn deployments to Kubernetes from a multi-step nightmare into every developer's dream: a single automated process that happens quickly and easily.  You will leave this session no longer dreading deploying Spring apps to Kubernetes and instead making your deployments painless and intuitive, unlocking the true power of Kubernetes.\r\n",

In this beginner-friendly session, we’ll introduce you to the core features of this high-performance table format and what it has to offer your data team as you build out your modern data lakehouse.\r\n\r\nWe’ll start by exploring where Iceberg fits within the context of data warehouses, data lakes, and other data storage formats. From there, you’ll be introduced to some of Iceberg’s key features, like schema evolution, hidden partitioning, and ACID-compliant transactions. You’ll see how these capabilities help to solve real-world challenges in scalability, performance, and data consistency. We won’t stop there, though! Next, we’ll go even deeper beneath the surface and explore the open-source tools, query engines, and catalogs that make up the Iceberg ecosystem. Through an end-to-end demo, you’ll see Iceberg in action and learn how you can leverage its features to streamline your data management and drive better insights.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the session, you’ll have the foundation you need to get started applying Iceberg to solve your own data challenges. So come along, and we’ll take the polar plunge together! ",

We’d like to think that the last decade and a half has dispelled us of that notion, but has it really? Often when organizations begin their “DevOps Transformation” they focus so much on automation, but the component that is more often than not overlooked is the human element. Human connection. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, Jeremy will dig into some strategies for building teams that actually work together, and might even come to like each other (though he can’t promise “meetings that are emails” will become a norm). He’ll talk about ways to encourage open communication, resolve conflicts, and create a team culture where everyone feels valued - because even the best automation tools can’t replace a team that actually works together.",

            "description": "What do you know about the code changes that were just introduced into the codebase? When will you start noticing if something goes wrong? If there are so many accessible observability sources that can tell us what the code is doing, why are we using so little of that in our day-to-day coding?\r\n\r\nContinuous Feedback is a new dev practice that aims to make practical usage of code runtime data to shorten the feedback loop during development. It enables developers to get early data about their code changes and detect issues and regressions as-they-code. At the same time, collecting data from multiple environments, allows developers to instantly understand how their code is performing in the real world.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll look past the novelty of using OSS observability tools and technologies, to discuss how we can actually make them useful for developers. We'll take a look at the benefits of enabling OpenTelemetry collection for dev and test data and examine OSS tools to help analyze the application runtime. Throughout the talk, we'll go over code examples of common anti-patterns, code smells, hidden errors, and other types of problems that observability can reveal - prior to merging a PR,\r\n\r\nUltimately, the goal should not be simply observing the application or creating nice-looking dashboards. Rather, success is in leveraging observability data in order to achieve a more effective dev process and write better code.",

What do we, as professional software developers, need to know before deciding to do a refactor on a legacy codebase? \r\n \r\nThe audience for this session are software developers and the people that interface with them (product owners, scrum masters, development managers) who need to know the value of this important and often neglected technical practice.\r\n \r\nAt the end of the session, the attendee will be able to identify hidden patterns in their code bases, plan a refactor effort on legacy codebases, write their own refactorings, and recognize accidental code complexity in large codebases.\r\n",

She'll use these examples to talk about what productivity is, what it is not, and why it's even more important to us as developers than it is to the organizations that pay our salaries. And it's of course important to them, too!\r\n\r\nAttendees will gain a deeper understanding of how IntelliJ IDEA helps them to be effective, productive, and happy.

Micro Frontends promise large teams the ability to independently ship pieces of applications without code collisions, bug creation, that can be team-agnostic, and with Webpack, Vercel, NX, and others leaning in to offer ways to federate code, this seems to be the way of the future.\r\n\r\nBut what problems aren't solved by Micro Frontends? There is a large gap in what large complex teams need to ship better software and what Micro Frontends are able to provide ... and that gap is the basis of this talk. We'll discuss the consequences that arise when attempting to implement MFE architecture that no on seems to want to talk about.",

From the early days of servlets, to JSP, Java web frameworks, Java  EE, and Spring, to today’s hip microservice frameworks, the platform has been a strong, solid player, relied upon by thousands of companies, governments, and organizations. But what do these microservice frameworks like Dropwizard, Spring Boot, and Eclipse MicroProfile have in common with the older days of Java? It turns out, there’s quite a lot of foundational tech that made the newer frameworks possible. In this talk, we’ll take a look at different parts of the foundation that you may not even realize you’re using, for everything like handling REST requests, processing JSON, using Web Sockets, talking to a database, performing validation, and more. We’ll also look at how these standards evolve within the Eclipse Jakarta EE, and what’s in store for the future.",

However, for many Java developers, integrating these powerful AI tools into existing enterprise applications or a new one can feel daunting. In this hands-on session, we'll demystify the process and show you how to build LLM-powered features directly into your Java codebase.\r\n\r\nUsing JakartaEE and the LangChain4j library, we'll dive deep into Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a cutting-edge technique that combines the vast knowledge of LLMs with the precision of your own data. We'll explore how to create both few-shot and zero-shot RAG models, and then add practical features like summarization and similarity search, backed by an Embedding database.\r\n\r\nThrough a live coding demo, we’ll walk you through constructing an AI-powered online store backend and provide practical insights into the architecture and code.\r\n\r\nWhether you're familiar with AI or just getting started, this session will give you the confidence and skills to harness the potential of LLMs in your Java projects. \r\n",

As business leaders, we just need to invest in and create urgency behind these solutions today, so that we don’t find ourselves having the same discussion again in a decade.\r\n",

If you wrote the tests correctly and they all pass, you should have a working prototype. Even better, if the tests pass and you trust the tests, the code is production ready!\r\n\r\nWith some live coding, we will explore this idea together. Furthermore we will take a look at the implications of this paradigm shift. After attending you should be able to apply this technique to your own project.",

              "description": "Generative AI has taken the world by storm over the last year, and it seems like every executive leader out there is telling us “regular” Java application developers to “add AI” to our applications. Does that mean we need to drop everything we’ve built and become data scientists instead now?\r\n\r\nFortunately, we can infuse AI models built by actual AI experts into our applications fairly straightforwardly, thanks to some new projects. We promise it’s not as complicated as you might think! Thanks to the ease of use and superb developer experience of Quarkus and the nice AI integration capabilities that the LangChain4j libraries offer, it becomes trivial to start working with AI and make your stakeholders happy :)\r\n\r\nIn this session, you’ll explore a variety of AI capabilities. We’ll start from the Quarkus DevUI where you can try out AI models even before writing any code. Then we’ll get our hands dirty with some code and exploring LangChain4j features such as prompting, chaining, and preserving state; agents and function-calling; enriching your AI model’s knowledge with your documents using retrieval augmented generation (RAG); and discovering ways to run (and train) models locally using tools like Ollama and/or Podman AI Lab. In addition, we’ll look at the AI integration's observability and fault tolerance and compile the app to a native binary. Maybe we’ll even try some new features, such as generating images or audio!\r\n\r\nCome to this session to learn how to build AI-infused applications in Java from the actual Quarkus experts and engineers working on the Quarkus LangChain4j extensions. This is also an opportunity to provide feedback to the maintainers of these projects and contribute back to the community.",

Developers are expected to co-create with AI, and check the generated output, or risk hallucinations running wild. This can aid development at a local machine, but what happens when you try to apply these tools on a massive scale?\r\n\r\nFor mass-scale code operations, AI needs to have agency, able to operate with some degree of autonomy. In this session, we’ll cover how you can use use techniques such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG), the richest code data source for Java called the lossless semantic tree (LST), and OpenRewrite rules-based recipes to drive more efficient and accurate AI model output for refactoring and analyzing large codebases.\r\n\r\nWe’ll specifically address how you can use AI embeddings as a powerful tool to visualize, analyze, and even do smarter sampling for your codebase. We’ll demonstrate using embeddings to perform searches, cluster data, get a birds-eye view of your codebase, as well as diagnose issues and recommend OpenRewrite recipes to fix the problem. We'll also show you how GenAI can be helpful at scale: by assisting with writing OpenRewrite deterministic recipes.\r\n\r\nCome learn the technical underpinnings for reliably using AI at scale for code modernization.",

              "description": "Java bytecodes and class files deliver on the original vision of “write once, run anywhere”.  Using a Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler allows JVM-based applications to compile only the code that’s being used frequently and optimise it precisely for how it is being used.  Using techniques like speculative optimisation can often deliver better performance than static, Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compiled code.\r\n\r\nHowever, this flexibility and performance comes at a cost.  Each time the JVM starts an application, it must perform the same analysis to find hot spots of code and compile them.  This is referred to as the application warmup time.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll look at several approaches to how this problem can be alleviated or even eliminated.  Specifically:\r\n\r\n•\tGenerating a JIT compiler profile of a running, warmed-up application that can be reused when the same application is restarted, eliminating the need for much of the JIT compilation.\r\n•\tOpenJDK Project Leyden's ahead-of-time class loading, method profiling and code compilation.\r\n•\tDecoupling the JIT compiler from the JVM for a Cloud environment.  Providing a centralised JIT-as-a-Service allows caching of compiled code and offloading the compilation work when new code must be compiled.\r\n•\tCreating a checkpoint of a running application.  This includes all application state (heap, stack, etc.) in addition to the JIT-compiled code.  Project CRaC will be used as an example.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the session, you’ll be all set to keep your Java hot!\r\n",

              "description": "Many native libraries offer powerful solutions to interesting problems that could greatly benefit Java developers. However, working with native code has traditionally been difficult on the Java platform. One had to contend with the boiler plate of writing JNI code in order to interact with native libraries. And it only got worse when trying to use native types, like structures, that have no java equivalent. Project Panama solves all these issues by introducing an FFI and Memory Access APIs that lets Java developers’ interop with native code seamlessly. Come to this session to learn more about how OpenJDK Project Panama can help you interact with native libraries seamlessly.",

By reframing security and compliance not as obstacles, but as catalysts for pushing the boundaries of productivity and technology we can gain  insights to what is needed to thrive in an evolving legal environment without stifling innovation.  \r\n\r\nAI, Software, and the Law – more opportunity than obstacle\r\n",

If there are so many accessible observability sources that can tell us what the code is doing, why are we using so little of that in our day-to-day coding?\r\n\r\nContinuous Feedback is a new dev practice that aims to make practical usage of code runtime data to shorten the feedback loop during development. It enables developers to get early data about their code changes and detect issues and regressions as-they-code. At the same time, collecting data from multiple environments, allows developers to instantly understand how their code is performing in the real world.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll look past the novelty of using OSS observability tools and technologies, to discuss how we can actually make them useful for developers. We'll take a look at the benefits of enabling OpenTelemetry collection for dev and test data and examine OSS tools to help analyze the application runtime. Throughout the talk, we'll go over code examples of common anti-patterns, code smells, hidden errors, and other types of problems that observability can reveal - prior to merging a PR,\r\n\r\nUltimately, the goal should not be simply observing the application or creating nice-looking dashboards. Rather, success is in leveraging observability data in order to achieve a more effective dev process and write better code.",

These are useful for having high-level conversations, but they don't cover the internal implementation details of your Java app. You consider creating a C4 component diagram. Unfortunately the size and complexity of your Java codebase makes manually drawing this out of the question, and reverse-engineering the codebase with a generic tool produces a cluttered diagram that literally shows everything. How do you create useful component level diagrams that remain up to date with minimal effort? Is this even possible?\r\n\r\nJoin me for a discussion of how to tackle this problem, where I'll cover the theory and tactics behind how to reverse-engineer meaningful component diagrams, before presenting a live demo of how to use the open source Structurizr DSL to put the techniques into action.",

So how can we bring the ease and speed of unit tests into these integration tests? Ideally, we’d like to use a local setup where we can quickly spin up and deploy our services in an emulated environment that’s as close as possible to the real deal. By simulating real-world scenarios and testing the integration of various parts of the system, these tests help us identify and resolve issues early in the development process. This is where Testcontainers and LocalStack work beautifully together to bring you the best of integration tests and cloud services on your machine. We’ll explore how we can enhance the testability of a Spring Boot application that relies on AWS services and vastly increase the test coverage of our applications without any need for mocking or remote AWS sandbox accounts.\r\n\r\nTesting your AWS-powered Spring Boot app with LocalStack and Testcontainers conveys isolation, speed, cost, and flexibility, making it effortless to get started with writing integration tests for your cloud application.",

Micro Frontends promise large teams the ability to independently ship pieces of applications without code collisions, bug creation, that can be team-agnostic, and with Webpack, Vercel, NX, and others leaning in to offer ways to federate code, this seems to be the way of the future.\r\n\r\nBut what problems aren't solved by Micro Frontends? There is a large gap in what large complex teams need to ship better software and what Micro Frontends are able to provide ... and that gap is the basis of this talk. We'll discuss the consequences that arise when attempting to implement MFE architecture that no on seems to want to talk about.",

From the early days of servlets, to JSP, Java web frameworks, Java  EE, and Spring, to today’s hip microservice frameworks, the platform has been a strong, solid player, relied upon by thousands of companies, governments, and organizations. But what do these microservice frameworks like Dropwizard, Spring Boot, and Eclipse MicroProfile have in common with the older days of Java? It turns out, there’s quite a lot of foundational tech that made the newer frameworks possible. In this talk, we’ll take a look at different parts of the foundation that you may not even realize you’re using, for everything like handling REST requests, processing JSON, using Web Sockets, talking to a database, performing validation, and more. We’ll also look at how these standards evolve within the Eclipse Jakarta EE, and what’s in store for the future.",

              "description": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet challenges persist in accuracy and explainability. This talk introduces GraphRAG, an innovative framework that integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with LLMs to address these issues. By leveraging the rich, structured data from KGs, GraphRAG refines LLM outputs, providing a robust context that enhances the precision of generated information. This integration not only improves the factual accuracy of responses but also significantly boosts model interpretability. We will demonstrate how GraphRAG utilizes the interconnected nature of KGs to ground LLMs in real-world knowledge, allowing for more reliable and transparent AI systems. Through practical examples and performance evaluations, attendees will see how this approach mitigates common limitations of traditional LLMs, such as ambiguity and information gaps. The session will highlight advancements in both the effectiveness and clarity of AI responses, showcasing the transformative impact of combining Graph Technology with LLMs. Join us to explore how GraphRAG is setting a new standard in enhancing AI's accuracy and explainability.",

Unfortunately containers alone haven’t fully isolated us the myriad of differences across platforms.  This session will cover ways that we can build, package, and deploy Java applications so they remain portable.  This enables scaling from cost-efficient and developer environments, to massive scale Kubernetes deployments.  Using examples with Spring, you’ll learn how to:\r\n\r\n* Abstract service configuration / binding\r\n* Utilize Testcontainers across local dev/test & CI\r\n* Efficiently avoid cold starts with CRaC and other techniques\r\n* Package applications most efficiently for the target platforms",

We’ll also cover Project CRAC (Coordinated Restore at Checkpoint), a game-changer for reducing startup times in containerized environments by allowing JVM applications to be suspended and restored with minimal overhead.\r\n\r\nFinally, we'll wrap up with the integration of Java 21's virtual threads, a revolutionary improvement in how Spring Boot handles high-concurrency tasks, greatly enhancing scalability and efficiency. Through live demos, you'll learn how to leverage these tools and techniques to optimize your Spring Boot applications for maximum runtime performance.",

She'll use these examples to talk about what productivity is, what it is not, and why it's even more important to us as developers than it is to the organizations that pay our salaries. And it's of course important to them, too!\r\n\r\nAttendees will gain a deeper understanding of how IntelliJ IDEA helps them to be effective, productive, and happy.

This shift will revolutionize not just how we write code but also the very essence of agile software development.\r\n\r\nAgile, a methodology born over 20 years ago, was crafted for a different era with its own unique challenges. While some principles remain timeless, others demand a fresh perspective in the age of AI-native development. Do we still need sprints when AI can prioritize tasks in real-time? And what happens to cross-functional teams when virtual specialists are at our fingertips?\r\n\r\nJoin Sven as he explores the evolving role of developers and the necessity to rethink human-to-human interaction in a world where AI is our primary coding companion.

Reluctance to refactor increases the cost of development. However, refactoring for the sake of doing so can lead to greater productivity loss as well.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will use data driven approach. We will take examples of code, measure code quality, and then use automated code transformation tools to refactor the code, and then, once again, measure the quality of code and see how much we have improved. This can help us to not only refactor faster but also see the benefits realized and motivate us to move faster with greater efficiency.",

Also, how do you debug the application? How do you even view the logs?  How do you securely build a container?\r\n\r\nIf this experience resonates with you, then this session is for you. \r\n\r\nIn this session, we show you a variety of tools and techniques that turn deployments to Kubernetes from a multi-step nightmare into every developer's dream: a single automated process that happens quickly and easily.  You will leave this session no longer dreading deploying Spring apps to Kubernetes and instead making your deployments painless and intuitive, unlocking the true power of Kubernetes.\r\n",

We’d like to think that the last decade and a half has dispelled us of that notion, but has it really? Often when organizations begin their “DevOps Transformation” they focus so much on automation, but the component that is more often than not overlooked is the human element. Human connection. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, Jeremy will dig into some strategies for building teams that actually work together, and might even come to like each other (though he can’t promise “meetings that are emails” will become a norm). He’ll talk about ways to encourage open communication, resolve conflicts, and create a team culture where everyone feels valued - because even the best automation tools can’t replace a team that actually works together.",

            "description": "Do you look like a famous meme character? Does someone you know? Knowing this information is vital—both for your career and your personal life. After all, am I the only one around here who wants to avoid [Angry Walter](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/am-i-the-only-one-around-here)? And who *wouldn't* want to work with  [Success Kid](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/success-kid-i-hate-sandcastles).\r\n\r\nBut can we even find out if we have a meme twin? There are lots of memes. And lots of people. How could we possibly search them all? Well, it's easier than you think if we turn those memes into embeddings and search them with a vector database!\r\n\r\nBut what's an embedding? And what's a vector database? Well, that's what I'll cover in this session. I'll begin by exploring embeddings, showing how unstructured data, such as text and images, can be translated into hyper-dimensional arrays—called vectors—using both common and custom AI models. Then I'll talk about vector databases, covering what they are and how you can use them to store and search those embeddings with embeddings of your own.\r\n\r\nOf course, we'll do this all by example. I've turned all the big memes—from [Ancient Aliens Guy](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ancient-aliens) to [Zombie Boy](https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/184608242/zombie-boy)—into embeddings and have loaded them into a vector database. I've built an application around these embeddings and that database. I'll show you the code and the queries of this application so that you can build something similar for yourself. And, most importantly, we'll take some photos during the session and use it all to find your meme twin!\r\n\r\nSo, are you ready to find your meme twin? Or are you ready to learn how to use this technology? I say, [Why Not Both](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/why-not-both-why-dont-we-have-both).",

Creating reactive pipelines, debugging them, and visualizing their execution can be complicated tasks, compounded by the complexities that arise when exceptions occur.\r\nJava Virtual Threads enable applications to scale while preserving the thread-per-request style programming. Just as operating systems create the illusion of abundant memory by mapping a large virtual address space to limited physical RAM, a Java runtime can create the illusion of many threads by mapping numerous virtual threads to a few OS threads.\r\nLet's explore Java virtual threads, including how they work under the hood, their use cases, and the APIs introduced by Project Loom. We'll also compare traditional threads with virtual threads through a simple programming example to see their benefits in action.",

In this installment we're going to look at how to build scalable systems and services using the amazing Spring Boot 3.4 release and all the umbrella projects that accompany it. \r\n\r\nWe'll look at the basics - a sort of desk check for the wayward Spring developer - to ensure that development itself is scalable when using Spring.\r\n\r\nWe'll look at the basics of data access and web programming with Spring. We'll look at data processing strategies, too.\r\n\r\nWe'll look at how to build modular, intelligent applications with Spring Modulith and Spring AI. \r\n\r\nWe'll look at how to build messaging and integration into our system. \r\n\r\nWe'll look at how to integrate security into the system, making passwords safe and then - ideally - avoiding them altogether. \r\n\r\nAnd we'll look at scaling and optimizing Spring applications, too. \r\n\r\nProduction is the happiest place on earth! Join me for this workshop and we'll learn how to get there with aplomb. ",

When applied in the wrong way code coverage can easily transform from your best friend that can boost a developer’s productivity into your worst enemy that throws the sand in the wheels of your developers' productivity machine.\r\n\r\nAfter many years of answering community questions about code coverage in the JaCoCo mailing list, StackOverflow, and in the Sonar community forum we learned that most software engineers don’t understand the purpose of code coverage and how to apply it correctly. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will dispel the most popular myths built around code coverage. This talk will help you understand the concept of code coverage, how it should be used, and how to boost your productivity with code coverage.",

Dealing with regressions, using the remote debugger and tips for conditional breakpoints will all be covered. You'll also learn how to open good issues against open source projects to quickly get the fixes you need.",

Writing automated tests before you write the associated production code, and refactoring both the test and production code once the test passes, is a key part of TDD.  So if you’re working on a project that is in production (or has lots of production code) but no automated tests, TDD can’t help much — but that’s where Approval Testing shines.\r\n\r\nApproval Testing compares the current behavior of existing code with it’s previously approved of behavior, and lets you know what (if anything) has changed. Instead of asserting that a number, or a simple string were returned, an approval test might compare a complex object with it’s approved version and let you know when things change.",

Everything is full of bugs, support is clueless, nothing works as described, and don’t even get me started on IoT protocols and the Cloud Native space. Oh, and how about taking half of the world’s air traffic offline because of a null pointer exception pushed to production without verification?\r\n\r\nAnd on top of what’s broken, the pace of innovation has crawled to a stop (except maybe in the AI space). There’s nothing materially new in the last ten versions of Android and iOS or the last hundred versions of Chrome and Firefox. Google spent months hyping a new login screen that ended up being just a rearrangement, and can you name one new exciting feature in any software older than five years (plugging in a ChatGPT bot doesn’t count)? When Facebook was bragging about breaking things, at least it was to move faster. What’s their excuse now?\r\n\r\nThis talk will dig into the reasons behind this technical decline, which we call “Technical Enshittification.” We’ll explore how technical debt, poor innovation practices, and stagnation in core products are dragging us down.\r\n\r\nWhile this talk probably won’t be able to fix the Googles, the Apples, and the Metas, we will focus on what you can do to prevent this decline in your own projects and companies.\r\n\r\nWe’ll discuss practical strategies to combat and prevent this mess, focusing on Developer Productivity Engineering (DPE), user-centered design, robust testing, and effective project management. Real-world examples will show how to keep IT services efficient, innovative, and user-friendly.\r\n\r\nJoin us to learn how to turn things around and ensure long-term success in today’s digital landscape.",

Some components in AI, like model serving, include Remote Code Execution (RCE) by design, like when loading pre-trained models from external sources.\r\n\r\nTraditional SCA and SAST approaches are not built for the AI ecosystem leaving a huge & insecure attack surface. \r\n\r\nAI models are often downloaded from the public web, from untrusted sources in common platforms like HuggingFace using the “trust_remote_code=True” flag when loading models.  So how do we better secure our AI stacks?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll examine some of the common security anti-patterns prevalent in AI engineering, such as security issues that are not classified as CVEs by design, or patched security issues that introduce breaking changes.\r\n\r\nWe’ll review the methods introduced for better security hygiene such as new checkpoint formats (model files on disk) - like SavedModel and SafeTensors. While SCA, SAST, and traditional approaches don't analyze model checkpoints, leaving these silent vulnerabilities in your stacks, we’ll demo through real code examples, why the runtime context is crucial to detect these security issues.",

Hexagonal Architecture (or Ports and Adapters) excels at producing loosely coupled, interchangeable components that fit well with DDD.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation I will introduce the Domain Driven Design and dive into the DDD concepts of Aggregates, Repositories, Value Objects, Services, Ubiquitous Language, Adapters, and Shared Kernels.  I will also build an application using these patterns and leverage Hexagonal Architecture for easy extensibility.  Testing will of course be included.\r\n\r\nYou will leave this presentation with a basic knowledge of Domain Driven Design, how to structure and test your application to implement DDD and how to use Hexagonal Architecture to extend your applications.\r\n\r\nNo slides; just live code.",

However, work (and life) can take over, and we often miss the changelog. This means we don't know what changed, and consequently fail to see how we can incorporate those in our usage of Git.\r\n\r\nIn this session we will look at some features you are probably aware of, but haven't used, alongside new features that Git has brought to the table. Examples include:\r\n\r\n- Rebase and interactive rebase\r\n- `restore`/`switch` and when to use them\r\n- worktrees\r\n- shallow-clones\r\n-  Git's filesystem monitor\r\n\r\nBy the end of this session, you will walk away with a slew of new tools in your arsenal, and a new perspective on how this can help you and your colleagues get the most out of Git.",

Input devices, printers, sensors and security gadgets would have their use case in many typical business apps. The \"sandbox\" by browsers has been worked around with several hacks ranging from browser plugins to native wrappers, but native apps have ruled when you need to connect to custom devices. Emerging new web standards may be changing the game forever.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will overview the possibilities (including workarounds and dirty hacks) to connect to various devices from your web apps. As a hands-on code example, we use Web Bluetooth API available in Chrome to collect ECG precise data from a wireless heart monitor belt. The row bytes are then sent over to the Java server for further analysis.",

            "description": "Manufacturing facilities, production lines, and industrial automation units have traditionally been disconnected from the internet. However, to stay competitive in the digital era, these systems must evolve into smart, interconnected networks by integrating key technologies such as digital twins and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which require internet connectivity and the cloud. As data volumes generated by industrial equipment are substantial, relying solely on cloud infrastructure becomes insufficient due to bandwidth limitations, latency issues, and the inability to handle real-time data processing effectively. Even more, it poses key security challenges. This is where edge computing becomes critical. Edge computing brings data processing closer to the source, reducing latency and bandwidth strain, enabling faster decision-making and seamless operations. This talk explores how industrial automation can safely and efficiently move online by leveraging Jakarta EE applications as edge computing units. The presentation will also highlights the features that application servers for Jakarta EE apps should offer to meet the demands of operational technologies and factory environments, such as security, reliability, scalability, and long-term support. The presentation showcase these opportunities through a demo build with Payara Platform.",

Often the developers who wrote it are not even in the company anymore. So how do you know if the code is still used? Often you simply don’t  know and so you take the code with you…from one release to another…and the codebase is growing.\r\nThis session will give you an idea about what you can do to get rid of legacy code.

In this talk, we'll slide down the slippery slope of why flaky tests are more than just a nuisance. They're time-sinks, morale crushers, and silent code quality killers.\r\n\r\nWe'll skate across real-life scenarios to understand how flaky tests can freeze your development in its tracks, and why sweeping them under the rug is like ignoring a crack in the ice. From delayed releases to lurking bugs, the stakes are high, and the costs are real.\r\n\r\nBut don't pack your parkas just yet! We're here to share expert strategies and insights on how to identify, analyze, and ultimately melt away these flaky tests. Through our combined experience, we'll provide actionable techniques and tools to make sure snow is the only flakiness you experience, ensuring a smoother, more reliable journey in software development.",

The age gap between the legacy code and the cutting-edge cloud environment requires careful consideration of compatibility, capability, performance, debuggability, observability, and security. If we are looking for a first-class cloud-native experience, then we need to focus on re-architecting, refactoring, and retargeting the code. On a positive note, this process provides an opportunity to enhance the system’s scalability, resilience, and maintainability using the latest cloud technologies. Enter application modernization! This session presents a practical approach to bridging the gap between legacy systems and modern execution environments. Attendees will learn not only best practices around application modernisation but also gain insights into how this approach turns challenges into opportunities for innovation, resulting in a more agile, scalable, and future-proof system.",

Creating reactive pipelines, debugging them, and visualizing their execution can be complicated tasks, compounded by the complexities that arise when exceptions occur.\r\nJava Virtual Threads enable applications to scale while preserving the thread-per-request style programming. Just as operating systems create the illusion of abundant memory by mapping a large virtual address space to limited physical RAM, a Java runtime can create the illusion of many threads by mapping numerous virtual threads to a few OS threads.\r\nLet's explore Java virtual threads, including how they work under the hood, their use cases, and the APIs introduced by Project Loom. We'll also compare traditional threads with virtual threads through a simple programming example to see their benefits in action.",

              "description": "The adoption of open-source AI software introduces a new family of vulnerabilities to organizations. Some components in AI, like model serving, include Remote Code Execution (RCE) by design, like when loading pre-trained models from external sources.\r\n\r\nTraditional SCA and SAST approaches are not built for the AI ecosystem leaving a huge & insecure attack surface. \r\n\r\nAI models are often downloaded from the public web, from untrusted sources in common platforms like HuggingFace using the “trust_remote_code=True” flag when loading models.  So how do we better secure our AI stacks?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll examine some of the common security anti-patterns prevalent in AI engineering, such as security issues that are not classified as CVEs by design, or patched security issues that introduce breaking changes.\r\n\r\nWe’ll review the methods introduced for better security hygiene such as new checkpoint formats (model files on disk) - like SavedModel and SafeTensors. While SCA, SAST, and traditional approaches don't analyze model checkpoints, leaving these silent vulnerabilities in your stacks, we’ll demo through real code examples, why the runtime context is crucial to detect these security issues.",

Hexagonal Architecture (or Ports and Adapters) excels at producing loosely coupled, interchangeable components that fit well with DDD.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation I will introduce the Domain Driven Design and dive into the DDD concepts of Aggregates, Repositories, Value Objects, Services, Ubiquitous Language, Adapters, and Shared Kernels.  I will also build an application using these patterns and leverage Hexagonal Architecture for easy extensibility.  Testing will of course be included.\r\n\r\nYou will leave this presentation with a basic knowledge of Domain Driven Design, how to structure and test your application to implement DDD and how to use Hexagonal Architecture to extend your applications.\r\n\r\nNo slides; just live code.",

When applied in the wrong way code coverage can easily transform from your best friend that can boost a developer’s productivity into your worst enemy that throws the sand in the wheels of your developers' productivity machine.\r\n\r\nAfter many years of answering community questions about code coverage in the JaCoCo mailing list, StackOverflow, and in the Sonar community forum we learned that most software engineers don’t understand the purpose of code coverage and how to apply it correctly. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will dispel the most popular myths built around code coverage. This talk will help you understand the concept of code coverage, how it should be used, and how to boost your productivity with code coverage.",

              "description": "In this session you’ll learn about Test-Driven Development (TDD), Approval Testing, and how using them can help you deliver better code in less time. \r\n\r\nTDD is a great way to ensure your code meets the business requirements and is easy for other developers to understand and modify. Writing automated tests before you write the associated production code, and refactoring both the test and production code once the test passes, is a key part of TDD.  So if you’re working on a project that is in production (or has lots of production code) but no automated tests, TDD can’t help much — but that’s where Approval Testing shines.\r\n\r\nApproval Testing compares the current behavior of existing code with it’s previously approved of behavior, and lets you know what (if anything) has changed. Instead of asserting that a number, or a simple string were returned, an approval test might compare a complex object with it’s approved version and let you know when things change.",

Millions of hardcoded plaintext credentials keep showing up online in easy-to-scan places year after year. Worse yet, adversaries have gotten very good at exfiltrating and validating these secrets.  Rotating the key or password after an attack is far too late. \r\n\r\nWhat if every credential that an adversary could find expired before they could exploit it? What if keys, just a few hours old, no longer worked? \r\n\r\nLet's embrace a future of proper secrets management and auto-rotating secrets. It might seem overwhelming at first to consider accomplishing this, especially if you have never tackled secrets management before, but for many systems, this is easier to achieve than you might realize.\r\n\r\nIn this session, you will \r\n- Get an update on the state of secrets sprawl\r\n- Diagram auto-rotation architectures\r\n- Plan a secrets audit and code refactor strategy\r\n- Start the email that will help you convince the team\r\n",

However, work (and life) can take over, and we often miss the changelog. This means we don't know what changed, and consequently fail to see how we can incorporate those in our usage of Git.\r\n\r\nIn this session we will look at some features you are probably aware of, but haven't used, alongside new features that Git has brought to the table. Examples include:\r\n\r\n- Rebase and interactive rebase\r\n- `restore`/`switch` and when to use them\r\n- worktrees\r\n- shallow-clones\r\n-  Git's filesystem monitor\r\n\r\nBy the end of this session, you will walk away with a slew of new tools in your arsenal, and a new perspective on how this can help you and your colleagues get the most out of Git.",

              "description": "Do you look like a famous meme character? Does someone you know? Knowing this information is vital—both for your career and your personal life. After all, am I the only one around here who wants to avoid [Angry Walter](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/am-i-the-only-one-around-here)? And who *wouldn't* want to work with  [Success Kid](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/success-kid-i-hate-sandcastles).\r\n\r\nBut can we even find out if we have a meme twin? There are lots of memes. And lots of people. How could we possibly search them all? Well, it's easier than you think if we turn those memes into embeddings and search them with a vector database!\r\n\r\nBut what's an embedding? And what's a vector database? Well, that's what I'll cover in this session. I'll begin by exploring embeddings, showing how unstructured data, such as text and images, can be translated into hyper-dimensional arrays—called vectors—using both common and custom AI models. Then I'll talk about vector databases, covering what they are and how you can use them to store and search those embeddings with embeddings of your own.\r\n\r\nOf course, we'll do this all by example. I've turned all the big memes—from [Ancient Aliens Guy](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ancient-aliens) to [Zombie Boy](https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/184608242/zombie-boy)—into embeddings and have loaded them into a vector database. I've built an application around these embeddings and that database. I'll show you the code and the queries of this application so that you can build something similar for yourself. And, most importantly, we'll take some photos during the session and use it all to find your meme twin!\r\n\r\nSo, are you ready to find your meme twin? Or are you ready to learn how to use this technology? I say, [Why Not Both](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/why-not-both-why-dont-we-have-both).",

              "description": "Did you notice how everything in IT is crap right now? Services are bloated, slow, and buggy, and the hardware requirements to run even the simplest applications are enormous. It’s not just me, right?  Everything is full of bugs, support is clueless, nothing works as described, and don’t even get me started on IoT protocols and the Cloud Native space. Oh, and how about taking half of the world’s air traffic offline because of a null pointer exception pushed to production without verification?\r\n\r\nAnd on top of what’s broken, the pace of innovation has crawled to a stop (except maybe in the AI space). There’s nothing materially new in the last ten versions of Android and iOS or the last hundred versions of Chrome and Firefox. Google spent months hyping a new login screen that ended up being just a rearrangement, and can you name one new exciting feature in any software older than five years (plugging in a ChatGPT bot doesn’t count)? When Facebook was bragging about breaking things, at least it was to move faster. What’s their excuse now?\r\n\r\nThis talk will dig into the reasons behind this technical decline, which we call “Technical Enshittification.” We’ll explore how technical debt, poor innovation practices, and stagnation in core products are dragging us down.\r\n\r\nWhile this talk probably won’t be able to fix the Googles, the Apples, and the Metas, we will focus on what you can do to prevent this decline in your own projects and companies.\r\n\r\nWe’ll discuss practical strategies to combat and prevent this mess, focusing on Developer Productivity Engineering (DPE), user-centered design, robust testing, and effective project management. Real-world examples will show how to keep IT services efficient, innovative, and user-friendly.\r\n\r\nJoin us to learn how to turn things around and ensure long-term success in today’s digital landscape.",

Perhaps it would make more sense to use JSON across the business pipeline without sacrificing performance nor missing benefits from the relational data world. this is what JSON Duality Views propose. In this session we'll explore options to enhance data driven applications written with Spring Boot, Quarkus, and Micronaut, enhancing your developer experience and increasing customer satisfaction.",

              "description": "Manufacturing facilities, production lines, and industrial automation units have traditionally been disconnected from the internet. However, to stay competitive in the digital era, these systems must evolve into smart, interconnected networks by integrating key technologies such as digital twins and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which require internet connectivity and the cloud. As data volumes generated by industrial equipment are substantial, relying solely on cloud infrastructure becomes insufficient due to bandwidth limitations, latency issues, and the inability to handle real-time data processing effectively. Even more, it poses key security challenges. This is where edge computing becomes critical. Edge computing brings data processing closer to the source, reducing latency and bandwidth strain, enabling faster decision-making and seamless operations. This talk explores how industrial automation can safely and efficiently move online by leveraging Jakarta EE applications as edge computing units. The presentation will also highlights the features that application servers for Jakarta EE apps should offer to meet the demands of operational technologies and factory environments, such as security, reliability, scalability, and long-term support. The presentation showcase these opportunities through a demo build with Payara Platform.",

They have an endless flood of tasks and responsibilities on their shoulders, whilst battling an ever-increasing sea of potential technologies and tools to use. Change is needed! So, build a dam with us through platform engineering and IDPs.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we’ll explore the concepts of platform engineering and Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) and how they can help to relieve the cognitive load on developers, help to standardize technologies and tools used throughout an organization, streamline CI/CD pipelines and in essence enable greater developer productivity. We’ll investigate how this can all be achieved in the cloud, with example applications running in OpenShift, with Red Hat Developer Hub as the basis of our IDP. Throughout this workshop, you’ll learn how to utilize Red Hat Developer Hub, an implementation of the Backstage CNCF project, to create an IDP and then how this can be shared with development teams to enable rapid, easy deployment of their applications. We’ll demo this with a range of technologies, runtimes and tools to really showcase just how flexible and personalised these IDPs can be to your own organization and application needs.",

              "description": "Embarking on a Java project involves employing the best strategies, patterns, and architectural decisions, all geared towards a customer-centric.\r\n\r\nYet, there exists an often overlooked facet: quality assurance. While not entirely disregarded, we, as developers, sometimes limit ourselves to performing the basic unity and integration tests, which may leave room for bugs.\r\n\r\nFortunately, there are several straightforward approaches and tools that can be implemented to deliver a bug-free project with minimal effort.\r\n\r\nDuring this presentation, you'll gain practical knowledge of the application of the following tools and approaches:\r\n\r\n- ArchUnit: Ensuring consistent adherence to architectural patterns, even when multiple developers making changes to the project\r\n- FindBugs: Employing static analysis to proactively identify potential bugs in your code, effortlessly.\r\n- SonarQube: Offering a suite of diverse metrics and enabling the establishment of quality gates to maintain a predetermined standard of quality\r\n- PiTest: Enabling the power of mutation testing to uncover bugs that may otherwise remain concealed.\r\n- TestContainers: Streamlining the process of running various components such as databases, services, and extensions, thereby minimizing the need for manual intervention\r\n\r\nThroughout the session, we'll delve into concrete examples, ensuring a hands-on experience",

Some organizations have tackled this endeavor easily, while others have delayed the process, waiting for the right time or technology to get started. In this session, we will describe the migration of a production application from a solo monolith to an application system augmented with MicroProfile microservices. In this case, the application team opted maximize the value of their investment: maintain the original application and enhance it with services that surround it. We will include technical challenges and how we overcame them using Helidon, an open-source framework that makes it easy to write Java microservices, including MicroProfile microservices that easily integrate with Jakarta EE applications.",
