There's no question that streaming is popular, but why is it so in-demand? Part of the draw for users is that streaming is unscripted, dynamic, and unpredictable. It's not the same old formulaic \"cookie-cutter\" content available via traditional mediums. Another attraction is the high level of interactivity with the content producer. What other medium provides live chat and interaction to viewers while they consume the content? Streaming gives the consumer a level of active participation in their entertainment instead of just passively consuming it. It's also highly accessible - anyone can set up a stream at little to no cost from the comfort of their own home or office - or anywhere as long as they have a modern mobile device and internet connectivity. But it's not just for video games - any application that needs to reach an audience can take advantage of the power of streaming to reach millions of users!",

            "description": "Have you ever had to code logic for navigations, loading/mutating/reloading data, or request cancellations in your apps? Have you ever gotten it wrong? Let me show you a future where you can let the new Remix Router handle all of that for you - all while coding in the UI library of your choosing.\r\n\r\nAt Remix we're _stoked_ about nested + data-driven routing. The `loaders`/`actions` approach pioneered by the Remix framework has completely changed how we think about writing our applications. The days of render-driven waterfall data loads -- and all the spinners that come with it -- are over, and the resulting UX/DX is amazing. We're so excited about this approach that we didn't think it was fair to keep this limited to the React ecosystem. We realized early on that this was a Web (not React) problem that needed a Web (not React) solution\r\n\r\nLet's walk through some of the problems with modern render/fetch-in-component approaches and look at how we can provide a much better experience for our users if we change the way we think about our application architecture. We'll look at the benefits of nested and data-driven routing, and the new framework-agnostic Remix Router driving React Router 6.4.0. We'll show how this router _vastly_ simplifies our mental model and reduces our application code, leading to better user experiences and fewer bugs! We gain this simplicity by embracing web standards and using things the browser already does _really_ well -- like handling forms, requests, and responses -- all while keeping the awesome UX provided by today's modern frameworks.\r\n\r\nFinally, we'll look at how we can leverage the Remix Router in frameworks beyond React. You'll be amazed at how much framework-specific code disappears when you're delegating the majority of your routing, loading, and mutating logic to the Remix Router. Say goodbye to all those `useState/useEffects` (React) or those `ref/watchEffects` (Vue) and focus on writing your presentation layer in the library of your choice. So whether you're rocking with React, vibing with Vue, or all about that Angular - you can leverage the Remix Router to provide great experiences for your users.",

However, with the shift of React to the server, companies not already using Node.js on the backend may shy away from this technology and thus lose out on any of the benefits it brings.\r\n\r\nBut it is as not as difficult as it seems! In this presentation, I will show how you can use tools such as containers and code generation to make it easy for server components to interface with your backend of choice during both development and deployment.",

We'll start with a basic component and work our way up, taking some time along the way to talk about props, slots, and the component lifecycle.\r\n\r\nSpotting patterns in how we use components can help us understand our front-end architecture and testing needs, find some language that we can use when talking with designers and other stakeholders about \"components\" as they see them, and be more clear when communicating with other developers in our own team about the actual Vue components that implement a given design.\r\n",

She’ll also give you some talking points to help convince your boss to take development time away from adding new features to focus on upgrading the tech stack to something that’s easier to work with.

If you are currently an engineer / tech lead and thinking about switching to an engineering  manager role, you may have several questions. You may be wondering if it’s the right move and if you have the right skills to succeed. Having made the transition a couple years ago, I can say I went through a steeper learning curve than I imagined. In this talk I will share some of the things I had to learn, and more importantly things I had to unlearn to be successful at engineering management.",

            "description": "Are you an adventurer? Do you want gold? Experience? Levels? Of course you do! And where do you get these things? The dungeon, where else? That wonderful container of all things adventurous! But, unfortunately, dungeons aren't setup for the convenience of adventurers who wish to extract these fine things. It’s almost as if the dungeon master just made the dungeon up at random. And so you wander about and you get what you get.\r\n\r\nBut you’re also a developer. You could build a database of all the rooms with their shiny and monstrous content. Then you could query it and find the optimal route to get the gold and the experience and the levels. But how would you model this data and write these queries? The rooms. The corridors. The monsters. The sparkling hoozits. That’s a lot of entities to relate to each other. And that’s gonna be a monster of a SQL query. Whoa–look at that JOIN! Better get my text editor ready.\r\n\r\nOr, you could use a graph database. A graph database allows you to model these relationships simply and intuitively with nodes and edges. Being schema-free, you can evolve your graph as you encounter new things such as traps or secret doors. And, using the Cypher query language, you can write elegant and easy to understand queries that find the best routes to get the stuff adventures desire most.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll use the aforementioned example to introduce you to the concepts of graph databases. I’ll compare how to solve this problem with a relational database and how a graph database makes it easier. I’ll show you how to query and modify your graph. And, as no talk would be complete without a live demo, I’ll do it all using a real-time procedurally generated random dungeon (I am a dungeon master after all).\r\n\r\nSo come, have a flagon of mead as you learn about graph databases, optimize your dungeon crawl, and equip another weapon in your quest for better software!",

Being cognizant of all the things that can go wrong and who are potential users are will take us farther along our journey.\r\n\r\nIn this session we are going to learn about common accessibility violations that surface when we are lackadaisical about the experiences we ship. We will cover semantic markup, alt attributes and images, color contrast, and more. Attendees will walk away able to identify these problem areas in their codebases and learning techniques, tools, and best practices to keep our users happy and not drive them mad.",

The Web is an amazing platform that offers developers a lot of ways to build amazing experiences. The only problem is...it requires some tricks to get the experience to not be terrible. So, if native is so great at performance, how can we make the web compete?\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at an app that comes with every iOS device and see what features set it apart from your standard web app. Then, with a minimal rebuild of this app, we'll add UX details that are not only performant, but also make user want to use your app.",

In the first 5 months of 2022, users consumed over 543 billion minutes of live video created by almost 9 million creators on Twitch. There's no question that streaming is popular, but why is it so in-demand? Part of the draw for users is that streaming is unscripted, dynamic, and unpredictable. It's not the same old formulaic \"cookie-cutter\" content available via traditional mediums. Another attraction is the high level of interactivity with the content producer. What other medium provides live chat and interaction to viewers while they consume the content? Streaming gives the consumer a level of active participation in their entertainment instead of just passively consuming it. It's also highly accessible - anyone can set up a stream at little to no cost from the comfort of their own home or office - or anywhere as long as they have a modern mobile device and internet connectivity. But it's not just for video games - any application that needs to reach an audience can take advantage of the power of streaming to reach millions of users!",

As a JavaScript developer, you might be tempted to use REST APIs across the board. Express is certainly a familiar framework, but it might now be the best choice. Enter KafkaJS. Using Kafka is a tool to ensure fluid communication across all of your microservices. To implement it with your JavaScript applications, you can use KafkaJS. In this talk, the attendees will learn how to use Kafka in the context of a JavaScript microservices architecture.\r\n",

The impact of these is far-reaching and the marketing behind it drives the overlay space as more and more unsuspecting companies and organizations sign contracts with these unscrupulous overlay vendors and get duped into thinking that an overlay will fix all their accessibility issues. In fact, they are more and more prevalent daily. \r\n\r\nI will go into what overlays are, why they create more barriers than they do remove them, and explain to the audience why they are harmful to the disabled community and what to do when you come across an overlay and how to fight back and make the Web more accessible by taking these overlays down.",

If you are currently an engineer / tech lead and thinking about switching to an engineering  manager role, you may have several questions. You may be wondering if it’s the right move and if you have the right skills to succeed. Having made the transition a couple years ago, I can say I went through a steeper learning curve than I imagined. In this talk I will share some of the things I had to learn, and more importantly things I had to unlearn to be successful at engineering management.",

              "description": "Are you an adventurer? Do you want gold? Experience? Levels? Of course you do! And where do you get these things? The dungeon, where else? That wonderful container of all things adventurous! But, unfortunately, dungeons aren't setup for the convenience of adventurers who wish to extract these fine things. It’s almost as if the dungeon master just made the dungeon up at random. And so you wander about and you get what you get.\r\n\r\nBut you’re also a developer. You could build a database of all the rooms with their shiny and monstrous content. Then you could query it and find the optimal route to get the gold and the experience and the levels. But how would you model this data and write these queries? The rooms. The corridors. The monsters. The sparkling hoozits. That’s a lot of entities to relate to each other. And that’s gonna be a monster of a SQL query. Whoa–look at that JOIN! Better get my text editor ready.\r\n\r\nOr, you could use a graph database. A graph database allows you to model these relationships simply and intuitively with nodes and edges. Being schema-free, you can evolve your graph as you encounter new things such as traps or secret doors. And, using the Cypher query language, you can write elegant and easy to understand queries that find the best routes to get the stuff adventures desire most.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll use the aforementioned example to introduce you to the concepts of graph databases. I’ll compare how to solve this problem with a relational database and how a graph database makes it easier. I’ll show you how to query and modify your graph. And, as no talk would be complete without a live demo, I’ll do it all using a real-time procedurally generated random dungeon (I am a dungeon master after all).\r\n\r\nSo come, have a flagon of mead as you learn about graph databases, optimize your dungeon crawl, and equip another weapon in your quest for better software!",

              "description": "Have you ever had to code logic for navigations, loading/mutating/reloading data, or request cancellations in your apps? Have you ever gotten it wrong? Let me show you a future where you can let the new Remix Router handle all of that for you - all while coding in the UI library of your choosing.\r\n\r\nAt Remix we're _stoked_ about nested + data-driven routing. The `loaders`/`actions` approach pioneered by the Remix framework has completely changed how we think about writing our applications. The days of render-driven waterfall data loads -- and all the spinners that come with it -- are over, and the resulting UX/DX is amazing. We're so excited about this approach that we didn't think it was fair to keep this limited to the React ecosystem. We realized early on that this was a Web (not React) problem that needed a Web (not React) solution\r\n\r\nLet's walk through some of the problems with modern render/fetch-in-component approaches and look at how we can provide a much better experience for our users if we change the way we think about our application architecture. We'll look at the benefits of nested and data-driven routing, and the new framework-agnostic Remix Router driving React Router 6.4.0. We'll show how this router _vastly_ simplifies our mental model and reduces our application code, leading to better user experiences and fewer bugs! We gain this simplicity by embracing web standards and using things the browser already does _really_ well -- like handling forms, requests, and responses -- all while keeping the awesome UX provided by today's modern frameworks.\r\n\r\nFinally, we'll look at how we can leverage the Remix Router in frameworks beyond React. You'll be amazed at how much framework-specific code disappears when you're delegating the majority of your routing, loading, and mutating logic to the Remix Router. Say goodbye to all those `useState/useEffects` (React) or those `ref/watchEffects` (Vue) and focus on writing your presentation layer in the library of your choice. So whether you're rocking with React, vibing with Vue, or all about that Angular - you can leverage the Remix Router to provide great experiences for your users.",

She’ll discuss the process of refactoring an application to modern JavaScript framework and potential strategies to mitigate technical debt along the way. She’ll also give you some talking points to help convince your boss to take development time away from adding new features to focus on upgrading the tech stack to something that’s easier to work with. Because if it ain’t broke, why should we fix it?",

Unlike Alice, we can navigate ourselves and our users around the chaotic abyss that we call the web. Shipping inaccessible experiences to our users can have unpleasant effects. Being cognizant of all the things that can go wrong and who are potential users are will take us farther along our journey.\r\n\r\nIn this session we are going to learn about common accessibility violations that surface when we are lackadaisical about the experiences we ship. We will cover semantic markup, alt attributes and images, color contrast, and more. Attendees will walk away able to identify these problem areas in their codebases and learning techniques, tools, and best practices to keep our users happy and not drive them mad.",

Large scale projects though, need to be approached with a bit more thought and design. Why not be inspired by tried and true design patterns from the Vue.js community at large.\r\n\r\nDuring the talk we discuss practical design patterns for making your large scale Vue.js projects more predictable including:\r\n\r\n- Adopting community standards\r\n- Component conventions\r\n- Routing conventions\r\n- Using sdks\r\n- Wrapping third-party libs\r\n- and more!",

It will use examples from my journey such as freeCodeCamp meetups, mentorships, hackathons, and civic hacking, providing actionable steps with accompanying learned insights.  These steps include : \r\n=> What is is open source learning?\r\n=> Establishing your learning goal and breaking down the steps to getting there. \r\n=> Understanding the importance of joining a community and being an active participant. \r\n=> Why you should blog and tweet your progress as you learn.\r\n=> Why and how you should contribute to open source?\r\n=> How to find activities such as hackathons, meetups, and civic hacking groups that will challenge you?\r\n=> Examine how to building a coding habit eg #100daysofCode. \r\n=> How using open source resources helps you to learn makes you a better and more valuable developer/ engineer. \r\n=> Etc ( anything else that may cater to the theme of the conference or meetup where this talk is being given).

But there is a different way. In this talk you will learn how to build massively available dynamic web apps with pure cloud functions. Functional Web Apps (FWA) are built with pure cloud functions, sport a builtin database and deploy quickly and reliably. No more waiting on slow builds. No more trading off a dynamic end user experience by pre-rendering spinners. We will build markup on the fly with the determinism and reliability of immutable deployments leveraging the power and simplicity of the ultimate building block: pure cloud functions.",

You then leave the networking event almost feeling worse than before (it maybe was the pizza) AND you didn't meet anyone new. Well, networking has changed especially because of Covid.

            "description": "Angular is a powerful web application framework that helps us build impressive enterprise applications, but as static \"Jamstack\" sites grow in popularity, those who maintain Angular apps may feel the grass is greener with other technologies that are optimized for faster page rendering. Fortunately, the open source tool Scully is a static site generator that works with Angular to pre-render content and deliver fast and secure websites that can still connect to APIs to render dynamic content as needed. In this talk, I will demonstrate Scully by showing how it can be added to an existing Angular project, explain how it actually works behind the scenes to produce the new static assets, and recommend some good practices for incrementally improving your Angular applications.",

There's a better way! \r\nIn this talk I will teach you about the flexbox layout model and CSS grid. We will cover these concepts at a high level, discuss why they are a better approach, and I will show you how to use them effectively. Used in tandem, these widely supported techniques can make your pages responsive, more accessible, and easier to build.",

And in order to build our beautifully designed apps with sophisticated interactions, we leverage the latest features in HTML, CSS and JavaScript available in our modern evergreen browsers.\r\n\r\nHowever, when web development was in its infancy two decades ago, things were drastically different. Sites had hit counters, used frames for navigation, and were updated manually via FTP. We used the blink tag and scrolling marquees! Let’s take a walk down memory lane (or have a history lesson) and have some laughs cringing at how sites looked, how they were built, and the rudimentary tooling we had to develop them.",

There are multiple patterns established by the Vue community and the programming community at large that can be adopted in order to make your codebases more predictable, maintainable, and extendable.\r\n\r\nVue can be used for large and small projects alike. Large scale projects though, need to be approached with a bit more thought and design. Why not be inspired by tried and true design patterns from the Vue.js community at large.\r\n\r\nDuring the talk we discuss practical design patterns for making your large scale Vue.js projects more predictable including:\r\n\r\n- Adopting community standards\r\n- Component conventions\r\n- Routing conventions\r\n- Using sdks\r\n- Wrapping third-party libs\r\n- and more!",

              "description": "In most applications, there is some data stored in a remote location from your application. With remote state, there is data fetching logic that you have to write and reuse across your app. Moreover, after handling the logic, you have to deal with caching, deduplicating multiple requests, optimistic updates and more. In this talk, we will learn about React Query and how it helps us overcome the challenges of dealing with remote state.",

When the session ends, you’ll have some ideas from real-world examples to ensure your users get the Goldilocks experience... not so much that it overwhelms them, not so little so that they're making decisions on stale data, but just the right amount of timely information.",

Fortunately, the open source tool Scully is a static site generator that works with Angular to pre-render content and deliver fast and secure websites that can still connect to APIs to render dynamic content as needed. In this talk, I will demonstrate Scully by showing how it can be added to an existing Angular project, explain how it actually works behind the scenes to produce the new static assets, and recommend some good practices for incrementally improving your Angular applications.",

And in order to build our beautifully designed apps with sophisticated interactions, we leverage the latest features in HTML, CSS and JavaScript available in our modern evergreen browsers.\r\n\r\nHowever, when web development was in its infancy two decades ago, things were drastically different. Sites had hit counters, used frames for navigation, and were updated manually via FTP. We used the blink tag and scrolling marquees! Let’s take a walk down memory lane (or have a history lesson) and have some laughs cringing at how sites looked, how they were built, and the rudimentary tooling we had to develop them.",

Pinia builds upon the lessons learned from the Vuex era, and introduces a few important changes to how we leverage global state in our apps.  In this talk, we'll go over those key differences, and then I'll share some of my thoughts on how I approach global state, when to reach for it and why it can set you up for success when scaling your codebase.",

It will use examples from my journey such as freeCodeCamp meetups, mentorships, hackathons, and civic hacking, providing actionable steps with accompanying learned insights.  These steps include : \r\n=> What is is open source learning?\r\n=> Establishing your learning goal and breaking down the steps to getting there. \r\n=> Understanding the importance of joining a community and being an active participant. \r\n=> Why you should blog and tweet your progress as you learn.\r\n=> Why and how you should contribute to open source?\r\n=> How to find activities such as hackathons, meetups, and civic hacking groups that will challenge you?\r\n=> Examine how to building a coding habit eg #100daysofCode. \r\n=> How using open source resources helps you to learn makes you a better and more valuable developer/ engineer. \r\n=> Etc ( anything else that may cater to the theme of the conference or meetup where this talk is being given).

You watched 45 slides on a topic that you don't understand only to leave the session and be even more confused. You then leave the networking event almost feeling worse than before (it maybe was the pizza) AND you didn't meet anyone new. Well, networking has changed especially because of Covid. In this session, I dig into how to build your LinkedIn profile where it gets attention from recruiters and hiring managers.  I also go over how to ACTUALLY network virtually on LinkedIn. After this session, you should feel very good on how to leverage this platform to connect with individuals! If you are an introvert...this session is for you!",
