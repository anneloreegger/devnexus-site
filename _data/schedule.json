            "description": "Data is everywhere. It's being produced by almost everything around you. In order for businesses to be competitive, they need to build resilient, scalable systems that can efficiently tap into and react to this ever-increasing volume of data. \r\n\r\nEnter: streaming data pipelines. Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform that allows you to move and transform data in real-time. Throughout this workshop, you’ll build up a solid foundation and understanding of Kafka, learning the basic building blocks of the technology, its components, as well as how to produce and consume data. From there, you’ll get hands-on experience ingesting data from external systems into Kafka using Kafka Connect, joining and transforming Kafka data in real-time with ksqlDB stream processing, and using Kafka Connect to move data to downstream systems.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the workshop, you'll understand the value of real-time data and have everything you need to start building your own streaming data pipeline.\r\n\r\nNote: This workshop will utilize a free Confluent Cloud account for hosting Kafka clusters, stream processing, and schema registry. Participants require some programming knowledge.",

One way to mitigate the risk is to evolve the architecture. But, there are risks of evolving as much as there are the risks of not evolving. In this interactive workshop we will explore a set of practices that we can use to mitigate the risks. Then we will dive into discussing some common and popular architectural patterns.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will take some example applications and discuss how to evolve architecture to meet the needs of those applications.",

We will cover the latest developments in Spring Framework 6, Spring Boot 3, and Micrometer. You will apply these fundamentals to realistic scenarios in sample applications where having observability is crucial. You will learn how to Migrate from Boot 2.x to 3, how to use the new AOT and GraalVM native-image support, how to effectively handle errors, how to integrate applications over HTTP via the new Interface Clients, how to avoid common issues, how to make these apps observable, what observability signals to watch, and how to integrate metrics with distributed tracing and logs.\r\nThis workshop is for people who want to learn about Spring Boot 3, Spring Framework 6 and observability. What new tools to use and how to use them with the applications they write so that they can face the cruel world of production.\r\n\r\nPrerequisites:\r\n- Very basic Spring Boot knowledge (how to create beans and HTTP endpoints), you can learn these from our online guides quickly, e.g.: https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/\r\n- Java 17 (or higher) installed\r\n- A Java IDE",

              "description": "Data is everywhere. It's being produced by almost everything around you. In order for businesses to be competitive, they need to build resilient, scalable systems that can efficiently tap into and react to this ever-increasing volume of data. \r\n\r\nEnter: streaming data pipelines. Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform that allows you to move and transform data in real-time. Throughout this workshop, you’ll build up a solid foundation and understanding of Kafka, learning the basic building blocks of the technology, its components, as well as how to produce and consume data. From there, you’ll get hands-on experience ingesting data from external systems into Kafka using Kafka Connect, joining and transforming Kafka data in real-time with ksqlDB stream processing, and using Kafka Connect to move data to downstream systems.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the workshop, you'll understand the value of real-time data and have everything you need to start building your own streaming data pipeline.\r\n\r\nNote: This workshop will utilize a free Confluent Cloud account for hosting Kafka clusters, stream processing, and schema registry. Participants require some programming knowledge.",

One way to mitigate the risk is to evolve the architecture. But, there are risks of evolving as much as there are the risks of not evolving. In this interactive workshop we will explore a set of practices that we can use to mitigate the risks. Then we will dive into discussing some common and popular architectural patterns.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will take some example applications and discuss how to evolve architecture to meet the needs of those applications.",

You will apply these fundamentals to realistic scenarios in sample applications where having observability is crucial. You will learn how to Migrate from Boot 2.x to 3, how to use the new AOT and GraalVM native-image support, how to effectively handle errors, how to integrate applications over HTTP via the new Interface Clients, how to avoid common issues, how to make these apps observable, what observability signals to watch, and how to integrate metrics with distributed tracing and logs.\r\nThis workshop is for people who want to learn about Spring Boot 3, Spring Framework 6 and observability. What new tools to use and how to use them with the applications they write so that they can face the cruel world of production.\r\n\r\nPrerequisites:\r\n- Very basic Spring Boot knowledge (how to create beans and HTTP endpoints), you can learn these from our online guides quickly, e.g.: https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/\r\n- Java 17 (or higher) installed\r\n- A Java IDE",

            "description": "Technical skills can be acquired by a wide variety of means such as getting a degree, earning a certification, or reading a tutorial. They are not sufficient, however, to be successful in a globally distributed and diverse world. Non-technical skills, aka soft skills, are the personal qualities that define how you interact with others. In a globally distributed and diverse world, soft skills are sometimes more critical and important than technical skills. These skills are needed whether you are a newbie or a veteran in the tech industry, an individual contributor or a manager. They help you to be an effective team player, inspire others in the team, and help make your team more successful. This talk explains five soft skills of communication, adaptability, conflict resolution, mindfulness, and kindness that help force multiple your team technical teams. You’ll learn how to master these skills to create an effective team environment and force multiple your technical talent. ",

Spring Batch provides a powerful framework for building and running batch applications that can be easily scaled. We will cover topics such as partitioning, parallel processing, and remote chunking, which can help increase throughput and reduce processing time. Additionally, we will explore best practices for designing batch jobs and using Spring Batch features effectively. By the end of the talk, attendees will have a solid understanding of using Spring Batch to scale their batch processing applications and easily handle large data volumes.",

            "description": "Apache Kafka is a distributed system. At the heart of Apache Kafka is a set of brokers, which allow to store the records persistently across different topics. Topics, in turn, are split into partitions. Dividing topics into such pieces allows us to use data from multiple partitions in parallel, so that producers and consumers can work with data simultaneously and achieve higher data throughput.\r\n\r\nSuch parallelization is the key to a performant cluster, however it comes with a price. The thing is, reading from multiple partitions will eventually mess up the order of records, meaning  that the resulting order will be different from when the data was pushed into the cluster. \r\n\r\nThis happens because when consuming data from multiple partitions, the order of partitions is not guaranteed. Instead, we must rely on the order of the records within a single partition, where the data is guaranteed to maintain the original sequence. We need to use this characteristic of Apache Kafka to our advantage in those cases where the ordering of the records is important for our system.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when building our product architecture we should carefully weigh up how we will balance records across partitions and what mechanisms we will use to ensure that the sequence of the messages remains correct when data is read by multiple consumers. And even more importantly, how to achieve this and still maintain good performance.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll discuss mechanisms you can use to balance your data, such as keys and custom partitioners, but also practices that will help you to balance data evenly and produce and consume data efficiently.\r\n\r\nIf you are fresh to Apache Kafka, or you're looking for good practices to design your partitions and avoid common pitfalls, you'll find this session useful!",

However, in real life applications have to deal with state - how do you scale stateful software systems and their data? This is where it may become scary - while modern storage solutions (from Etcd to Cassandra) promise to solve this problem for us, operating these solutions may be tricky. Even if you don’t have to reimplement underlying consensus algorithms (like Paxos and Raft), you still need to understand how they work to operate, debug, and scale your systems. \r\n\r\nThis talk explains the mechanics of different consensus algorithms in everyday terms. This talk is not an academic paper: instead of providing formal proofs and scientific language, it focuses on practical aspects of consensus algorithms’ usage. It explains actionable insights in (relatively) simple words without pitching a concrete approach or technology as a magic cure.",

The data engineer does this to be useful for the data scientist. The data engineer is also versant in Java and Scala and will be knowledgeable in pub-subs like Kafka.\r\n\r\nThe data scientist uses that data, does their cleaning, and investigates possible patterns designing a machine learning model that we can use to either find regressions or classifications for our data. The data scientists use Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Tensorflow, and Matplotlib as their tools of choice for constructing a machine-learning model to make decisions about the data.\r\n\r\nThis presentation answers the question. How do we take that model and tie it to everything else? This workshop will use a wide array of technologies. It will set you on the path to running Machine Learning Pipelines in Kubernetes using Kafka and Tensorflow, so you can start immediately when you return to work.",

In this session, we'll go over the fundamentals of k8s to make your journey into using it simpler and more enjoyable. \r\n\r\nIn a true Java fashion we'll start with a Factory... kidding! with a test-driven exploration of what k8s is, its concepts and capabilities and learn why it's such a powerful tool.\r\n\r\nWe'll write tests that spin real k8s clusters with Testcontainers, explore what happens inside, break the assumptions, and truly get that first hands-on experience that'll make you both confident and a bit dangerous at working with this 10-letter staple of the clouds.\r\n\r\nPS. there will be yaml, but as little as possible, pinky promise!",

            "description": "Initially, getting Java to run on Kubernetes may seem complicated, but after a few lines of YAML and a bit of work with Docker, you will wonder what all that fuss was. It is easy! Then you start looking at the performance of your Java app in one core, one GB of memory container, and this is when it all very quickly gets murky. Ops, SREs, and Java developers need to be aware of the JVM's inner works when deciding on how to resource their applications. Without this knowledge, it isn't easy to know whether it is best to scale vertically or horizontally for performance and costs. This talk will explore JVM ergonomics, CPU throttling, Garbage Collectors, and how using this knowledge can help you increase performance while reducing costs in the cloud.",

            "description": "Every technology has that key concept that people struggle to understand. With databases, is which join clause to use for fetching data from multiple tables. Containers are tricky when you have to pick a storage type given some persistence requirements. With Apache Kafka, the winner is how many partitions to set for a topic.\r\n\r\nWhy this is important? You may ask. Well, sizing Kafka partitions wrongly affects many aspects of the system, such as storage, parallelism, and durability. Worse, it may also affect how much load Kafka can handle. Hence why often the decision about how many partitions to set for a topic is handled by Ops teams, as we see this to be only an infrastructure matter. In reality, this is an architectural design decision that affects even the amount of code you write.\r\n\r\nThis session will peel off the concept of partitions and explain it from the perspective of the Kafka cluster and its clients. It will explain the formula people should use to decide how many partitions to set for a topic, and how to spot a poor decision when they see one.",

            "description": "Jakarta EE and MicroProfile are powerful platforms for developing applications and microservices. Attendees of this session will learn important features of Jakarta EE and MicroProfile through a number of examples, using a hands on approach, correlating usage of the APIs to real-life scenarios. The examples presented will showcase both established and recently released features of Jakarta EE 10 and MicroProfile 6. The focus will be on some of the most important features from a variety of specifications, ranging from Jakarta Faces to Jakarta WebSockets and MicroProfile Config. The demo’s provide an overview of each, including how specifications complement each other. In order to run these examples, we will use server-side resources using Payara, and development of microservices with Payara Micro and Docker. \r\nAttendees will walk away with a solid understanding of some of the most important features of Jakarta EE and MicroProfile.\r\n",

So, why should Spring developers care?\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, the namespace changes ripple throughout the entire Java ecosystem. And Spring is no exception. Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3 raise their baseline to Jakarta EE 9 API level which is supported by Tomcat 10 and Jetty 11 for example.\r\n\r\nAttending this session will teach you how to make this migration as smoothly as possible. A live coding demo will take you through the steps involved, and point out where to pay special attention.\r\n\r\nWe will also briefly examine some of the changes introduced in **Jakarta EE 10** that will prepare you for what to expect from Spring 6.x. Some pointers to what we can expect from **Jakarta EE 11** will also be given.",

            "description": "Tasks from our everyday lives, such as cooking, involve initiating and accomplishing multiple sub-tasks. Over time, we usually master or improve upon these processes with practice. Let’s apply these two concepts;  a cooking recipe and hands-on coding experience, to learn more about Java’s Future and CompletableFuture API, important \"utensils\" to cater to asynchronous or non-blocking needs in Java.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll walk through centuries old Indian recipe ‘Paneer Tikka Masala’- a dish cherished by folk across the globe. In the talk, we’ll draw a parallel between the challenges of our recipe’s parts which involve asynchronicity and non-blocking activities, and how Java's APIs can address them in similar situations in your application code.\r\n\r\nLearning these concepts using Coding Katas, together we will fix failing code, hands-on, and learn how to work with Java’s CompletableFuture. By following a trail of TODOs and HINTs in the code, and an accompanying README, all integrated in the same project, you’ll experience the code, rather than just watching a deck, in an Integrated Development Environment!\r\n\r\nIf you are a library or an API author, this talk may inspire you to create Code Katas to help others understand and correctly use your libraries/API.\r\n\r\nWith this session you’ll learn how to make Paneer Tikka Masala and while learning new or better ways to use Java asynchronous and non-blocking APIs.",

            "description": "When you think about 1,700 developer days (or 4.8 years of time) in the engineering world, how does that make you feel? To me, it feels like infinity. Technical debt can show up like this in an organization. It’s a backlog of issues—migrating software, cleaning up code, and fixing security vulnerabilities—that can paralyze engineering organizations and lead to burnout. And the reality of modern applications is that they naturally accrue tech debt. They are composed of large and diverse codebases and ecosystems—a supply chain of custom, third-party, and open source software. Dependencies are changing frequently and evolve at their own pace. Not updating leads to critical bugs, performance, and security issues. The key to fixing your technical debt dilemma is continuous software modernization. You’ll never get behind when maintenance work that would normally take many months of manual effort can be automated and completed with a PR in minutes. This is how developers stay energized and your business can thrive.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll introduce OpenRewrite, an open source, auto-refactoring technology that was born at Netflix in 2016. It uses sophisticated, fast code search capabilities in combination with powerful change recipes that actually fix the code. I’ll share a use case of a common issue remediation—running a recipe live that fixes the issue and executing it across 300 million lines of open source code. The recipe will be made available in open source for you to apply to your own codebase at the end of the session.\r\n\r\nKey Take-aways:\r\n\r\n* Technical debt can be reframed as continuous software modernization with robust automation that not only finds the issues, but fixes them regularly.\r\n* OpenRewrite uses a similar approach as an IDE to automate refactoring, but takes it out of single person, single repo mode, so it can be delivered in different ways. The refactoring is 100% accurate and style preserving.\r\n* You can see immediate results using the open source change recipes from OpenRewrite—just try out one recipe and get days of your time back!\r\n* Moderne has a Saas platform that works with OpenRewrite recipes to help you execute continuous software modernization at scale—across repositories simultaneously\r\n",

With all that new Java releases and features also come new vulnerabilities and exploits. Because Java is everywhere, it has a huge attack surface which makes it interesting for hackers to search for vulnerabilities in Java and foremost in Java based applications. This sessions will explain what all these mystique acronyms like NVD, CVE, CVSS, CPU, PSU etc. mean and how they are related to Java security. It will also be shown what tools are available to you to check whether your Java application is vulnerable to known issues.",

Software supply chain attacks are on the rise with security exploits directly targeting open source projects, central repositories, and software package managers. Now that developers are the target of security attackers, how do you protect your DevOps pipeline?\r\n\r\nThis is a problem that the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF)  is working to solve.. To help ensure a secure SDLC, the CDF is investing in projects that provide security solutions and in 2022 announced a new incubating project, Pyrsia. This talk will highlight the importance of securing your software supply chain at the source and how Pyrsia is working to solve this problem.",

However, managing complex applications, including those built for multiple cloud environments, can be challenging, especially when it comes to tasks such as configuring, upgrading, and monitoring.\r\nKubernetes Operators are a powerful extension to Kubernetes that provides a way to automate the management of complex applications, including tedious DevOps and administrative operations. \r\nOperators are in fact software extensions that can be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster to monitor specific Custom Resources Definitions (CRD) defined by the admins. \r\nThey will ultimately enable developers to automate routine and repetitive tasks, simplify application management, and scale applications more efficiently.\r\nMo Haghighi, Distinguished Engineer at Discover Financial Services, will explore the advantages of Kubernetes operators for boosting developers’ productivity and how enterprises can expedite their modernisation journey and automate their multi-cloud deployment by adopting operators.

Code that uses blocking APIs or performs CPU-bound operations can have a significant impact on application responsiveness. Using Worker Threads can help alleviate pressure on the event-loop, but scaling out more replicas also plays an important role.\r\n\r\nJoin this session for a practical introduction to Kubernetes autoscaling, and KEDA. We'll examine an application that suffers reduced throughput and increased latency due to CPU-bound tasks blocking the event-loop. We'll then explore how Worker Threads and autoscaling features provided by Kubernetes and KEDA can keep our application both highly-available and responsive.",

The presenter will then lead attendees on a Live Coding Adventure(TM) to demonstrate how to create candidate functions using the power of Spring Boot and Spring Cloud Function. Finally, we will deploy these open source functions via Azure Functions to demonstrate how to integrate everything in the cloud and reveal some potentially very welcome discoveries.

From circuit breakers to security to queues to Kubernetes, Spring has an answer to that! But breadth can be overwhelming especially when you need to deploy to production yesterday. While knowing maybe half the battle, left unsaid is applying that knowledge to real-world situations; in other words, how do you bridge the gap between knowing Spring can do that to actually using Spring to fix your issue? With a plethora of examples, this talk will walk you through common problems in modern software development. From monitoring to testing to messaging to reactive programming, this talk will give you concrete solutions for your day-to-day needs.",

            "description": "When designing software systems, architects and developers have plenty of architectural options from which to choose.  Over the last few years, we have seen the growth of Microservice-based systems. However, the idea of monolithic, modular systems has recently regained popularity.  Regardless of which architecture we choose, how can we build the individual applications that comprise our overall system such that their structure is evolvable to follow business requirements?\r\nWhat if I were to tell you there was a way for you to express these logical application modules in code so that you can build well-structured, domain-aligned Spring Boot applications?  Spring Modulith does this by providing the developer a way to declare logical modules in Spring Boot applications.  It also provides the tooling needed to write Junit tests that run structural validation tests, run integration tests for individual modules, and to document the module arrangement.  It also has features that let you implement module interactions in a loosely coupled way and then lets you observe module interactions between each other at runtime.  In this talk, we discuss the features that are available and then in a live coding demonstration show you how they work.",

            "description": "Adaptive, just in time (JIT) compilation provides a massive performance improvement to JVM-based applications compared to only using an interpreter.  The downside of this is that applications have to compile frequently used methods as the application is running.  This can lead to reduced throughput and slower response times.  Another drawback is that each time an application is started, it must perform the same analysis to identify hot spot methods and compile them.\r\n\r\nWhen running an application in the cloud, the elastic nature of resources provides the ability to change and improve the dynamics of how the JIT compiler works.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll look at Azul's work to move the JIT compiler into a centralized service that can be shared by many JVMs.  This provides many advantages, such as caching compiled code for instant delivery when restarting the same application or spinning up new instances of the same service.  In addition, it removes the workload from individual JVMs, allowing them to deliver more transactions per second of application work.  Finally, there is the opportunity to apply considerably more compute resources to enable complex optimizations to be used that wouldn't be practical in a single JVM.\r\n",

We are entering a new and long-tail phase of software development with Machine Learning (ML). ML, a subset of AI, is the ability of a machine to produce accurate results for a particular problem without any explicit programming. These predictive results are derived from recognizing patterns in large data sets. We are effectively giving machines the ability to gain experience.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWith the new generation of “generative AI/ML” tools such as ChatGPT, DALL-E, Bard, Stable Diffusion, et al., this megatrend affects our applications, software tools, data structures, systems architecture, new hardware approaches, business processes, organizational interactions, enterprise strategies, government behavior, geopolitical strengths, ethics, data privacy, etc. In essence, ML is an inflection point for computing, enterprises, countries, humanity, and civilization. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe’ll explore some basic ML use cases, take a look at JSR #381 (Visual Recognition for Java), dive into the ChatGPT API, show some demos, and then discuss what all this means for Java developers.",

There are different performance concerns that need to be taken into account when deploying to the cloud in comparison to traditional deployments. With serverless and FaaS models, startup time and memory footprint play a big role, as it determines the cost of deploying to the cloud. Come to this session to learn more about how technologies like checkpoint/restore and remote JIT compilation can help boost startup time and reduce memory footprint to minimize your costs. You'll also learn how these features integrate seamlessly with existing container technologies for simple, secure and predictable deployments. Whether you are a cloud veteran or a new comer, there will be lots to learn!",

It's easy to find one or more plugins that implement desired functionality, however, it's hugely disappointing when a plugin provides an awesome capability, but wreaks havoc on the performance of the build, creates undesirable side effects, or doesn't work with a certain version of Gradle.  If only every Gradle plugin was written and tested well.\r\n\r\nThis talk is intended for Gradle plugin authors who want to learn how to write plugins that consumers will love to use.  We'll explore the following concerns by looking at an example plugin and discussing ways to improve it:\r\n\r\n- Plugin architecture\r\n- Task configuration avoidance\r\n- Configuration cache compatibility\r\n- Planning for and testing with the build cache\r\n- Backwards compatibility testing \r\n \r\nYou'll learn strategies for not only writing your plugin well, but keeping it healthy and well behaved as it evolves and new versions of Gradle are released.",

Wardley Mapping is one of the best tools in our arsenal for seeing the road ahead clearly, and getting to where we need to be. Having learned a lot about planning while being a stay-at-home parent, Valarie has a unique take on how to manage time and resources, and especially children… I mean, coworkers.\r\n\r\nDuring this presentation we’ll cover the basics of Wardley Mapping, in the context of both an automation process, as well as a life project. Because the best tools are multitaskers, and should be able to be used for more than one purpose!",

Troubleshooting, digging through logs, editing configuration files, you name it. If you're used to working with Windows or OSX GUI's, the Linux terminal might appear fairly basic and difficult to use.\r\n\r\nBut, with some basic background knowledge and a small set of terminal commands in your toolbox, it can actually be extremely powerful and loads of fun!\r\n\r\nIn this session, I'll explain the concepts behind the Linux command line and I'll demo loads of useful stuff. You'll learn how to quickly navigate, find files, examine and search through logs, how to investigate a system under load, a bit of shell scripting, ssh tunneling and more!\r\n\r\nAt the end of this session, you'll have the chance to throw your own problems and use cases at me - I'll come up with solutions on the spot. Bring your own problems ;-)\r\n\r\nThis talk takes places entirely in the command line. No slides, no IDE, just a plain terminal window. After this session, you'll be on your way to master the Linux command line yourself!",

Productivity is king after all.\r\nNow though we’ve got to deal with an increased focus on security - can we add that in and still deliver as before or does something break?\r\nIn this session we’ll introduce you to several ways to deal with the challenge.

There are numerous ways in which you can use open-source software and be worse off than if you did not.\r\n\r\nJoin me in this talk to find out how not to leverage open-source software in your organisation and your projects. Find out why reading the documentation may not always be your best bet, or how a workaround may eventually work against you.

They are not sufficient, however, to be successful in a globally distributed and diverse world. Non-technical skills, aka soft skills, are the personal qualities that define how you interact with others. In a globally distributed and diverse world, soft skills are sometimes more critical and important than technical skills. These skills are needed whether you are a newbie or a veteran in the tech industry, an individual contributor or a manager. They help you to be an effective team player, inspire others in the team, and help make your team more successful. This talk explains five soft skills of communication, adaptability, conflict resolution, mindfulness, and kindness that help force multiple your team technical teams. You’ll learn how to master these skills to create an effective team environment and force multiple your technical talent. ",

In this talk we will present our experience using it to develop trading engines at the Intercontinental Exchange, and the tradeoffs we made to keep it from slowing us down. ",

Batch processing is a common requirement for many enterprise applications, but processing time can become a bottleneck as data volumes grow. Spring Batch provides a powerful framework for building and running batch applications that can be easily scaled. We will cover topics such as partitioning, parallel processing, and remote chunking, which can help increase throughput and reduce processing time. Additionally, we will explore best practices for designing batch jobs and using Spring Batch features effectively. By the end of the talk, attendees will have a solid understanding of using Spring Batch to scale their batch processing applications and easily handle large data volumes.",

              "description": "Initially, getting Java to run on Kubernetes may seem complicated, but after a few lines of YAML and a bit of work with Docker, you will wonder what all that fuss was. It is easy! Then you start looking at the performance of your Java app in one core, one GB of memory container, and this is when it all very quickly gets murky. Ops, SREs, and Java developers need to be aware of the JVM's inner works when deciding on how to resource their applications. Without this knowledge, it isn't easy to know whether it is best to scale vertically or horizontally for performance and costs. This talk will explore JVM ergonomics, CPU throttling, Garbage Collectors, and how using this knowledge can help you increase performance while reducing costs in the cloud.",

Oh, and did I mention that it uses SOAP, JSP, and JSF 1.2? We did all this with a relatively minor amount of code changes, thanks to the backward compatibility of Java 8 and Java EE. Come to this session to learn how we did it, what issues we ran into, which app server we were using, and why we didn't move to a newer JDK, Java EE 8 or Jakarta EE.",

Over time, we usually master or improve upon these processes with practice. Let’s apply these two concepts;  a cooking recipe and hands-on coding experience, to learn more about Java’s Future and CompletableFuture API, important \"utensils\" to cater to asynchronous or non-blocking needs in Java.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll walk through centuries old Indian recipe ‘Paneer Tikka Masala’- a dish cherished by folk across the globe. In the talk, we’ll draw a parallel between the challenges of our recipe’s parts which involve asynchronicity and non-blocking activities, and how Java's APIs can address them in similar situations in your application code.\r\n\r\nLearning these concepts using Coding Katas, together we will fix failing code, hands-on, and learn how to work with Java’s CompletableFuture. By following a trail of TODOs and HINTs in the code, and an accompanying README, all integrated in the same project, you’ll experience the code, rather than just watching a deck, in an Integrated Development Environment!\r\n\r\nIf you are a library or an API author, this talk may inspire you to create Code Katas to help others understand and correctly use your libraries/API.\r\n\r\nWith this session you’ll learn how to make Paneer Tikka Masala and while learning new or better ways to use Java asynchronous and non-blocking APIs.",

And while functions may not have a perfectly precise definition in terms of size or scope, we're far more likely to reach general agreement on functions - their purpose, scope, pros/cons, and utility - than we are to ever locate those missing servers. :)\r\n\r\nIn this session, the presenter examines what makes a capability or set of capabilities ideal candidate(s) for development and deployment as one or more functions. The presenter will then lead attendees on a Live Coding Adventure(TM) to demonstrate how to create candidate functions using the power of Spring Boot and Spring Cloud Function. Finally, we will deploy these open source functions via Azure Functions to demonstrate how to integrate everything in the cloud and reveal some potentially very welcome discoveries.

              "description": "Adaptive, just in time (JIT) compilation provides a massive performance improvement to JVM-based applications compared to only using an interpreter.  The downside of this is that applications have to compile frequently used methods as the application is running.  This can lead to reduced throughput and slower response times.  Another drawback is that each time an application is started, it must perform the same analysis to identify hot spot methods and compile them.\r\n\r\nWhen running an application in the cloud, the elastic nature of resources provides the ability to change and improve the dynamics of how the JIT compiler works.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll look at Azul's work to move the JIT compiler into a centralized service that can be shared by many JVMs.  This provides many advantages, such as caching compiled code for instant delivery when restarting the same application or spinning up new instances of the same service.  In addition, it removes the workload from individual JVMs, allowing them to deliver more transactions per second of application work.  Finally, there is the opportunity to apply considerably more compute resources to enable complex optimizations to be used that wouldn't be practical in a single JVM.\r\n",

              "description": "Apache Kafka is a distributed system. At the heart of Apache Kafka is a set of brokers, which allow to store the records persistently across different topics. Topics, in turn, are split into partitions. Dividing topics into such pieces allows us to use data from multiple partitions in parallel, so that producers and consumers can work with data simultaneously and achieve higher data throughput.\r\n\r\nSuch parallelization is the key to a performant cluster, however it comes with a price. The thing is, reading from multiple partitions will eventually mess up the order of records, meaning  that the resulting order will be different from when the data was pushed into the cluster. \r\n\r\nThis happens because when consuming data from multiple partitions, the order of partitions is not guaranteed. Instead, we must rely on the order of the records within a single partition, where the data is guaranteed to maintain the original sequence. We need to use this characteristic of Apache Kafka to our advantage in those cases where the ordering of the records is important for our system.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when building our product architecture we should carefully weigh up how we will balance records across partitions and what mechanisms we will use to ensure that the sequence of the messages remains correct when data is read by multiple consumers. And even more importantly, how to achieve this and still maintain good performance.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll discuss mechanisms you can use to balance your data, such as keys and custom partitioners, but also practices that will help you to balance data evenly and produce and consume data efficiently.\r\n\r\nIf you are fresh to Apache Kafka, or you're looking for good practices to design your partitions and avoid common pitfalls, you'll find this session useful!",

Attendees of this session will learn important features of Jakarta EE and MicroProfile through a number of examples, using a hands on approach, correlating usage of the APIs to real-life scenarios. The examples presented will showcase both established and recently released features of Jakarta EE 10 and MicroProfile 6. The focus will be on some of the most important features from a variety of specifications, ranging from Jakarta Faces to Jakarta WebSockets and MicroProfile Config. The demo’s provide an overview of each, including how specifications complement each other. In order to run these examples, we will use server-side resources using Payara, and development of microservices with Payara Micro and Docker. \r\nAttendees will walk away with a solid understanding of some of the most important features of Jakarta EE and MicroProfile.\r\n",

We are entering a new and long-tail phase of software development with Machine Learning (ML). ML, a subset of AI, is the ability of a machine to produce accurate results for a particular problem without any explicit programming. These predictive results are derived from recognizing patterns in large data sets. We are effectively giving machines the ability to gain experience.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWith the new generation of “generative AI/ML” tools such as ChatGPT, DALL-E, Bard, Stable Diffusion, et al., this megatrend affects our applications, software tools, data structures, systems architecture, new hardware approaches, business processes, organizational interactions, enterprise strategies, government behavior, geopolitical strengths, ethics, data privacy, etc. In essence, ML is an inflection point for computing, enterprises, countries, humanity, and civilization. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe’ll explore some basic ML use cases, take a look at JSR #381 (Visual Recognition for Java), dive into the ChatGPT API, show some demos, and then discuss what all this means for Java developers.",

It's easy to find one or more plugins that implement desired functionality, however, it's hugely disappointing when a plugin provides an awesome capability, but wreaks havoc on the performance of the build, creates undesirable side effects, or doesn't work with a certain version of Gradle.  If only every Gradle plugin was written and tested well.\r\n\r\nThis talk is intended for Gradle plugin authors who want to learn how to write plugins that consumers will love to use.  We'll explore the following concerns by looking at an example plugin and discussing ways to improve it:\r\n\r\n- Plugin architecture\r\n- Task configuration avoidance\r\n- Configuration cache compatibility\r\n- Planning for and testing with the build cache\r\n- Backwards compatibility testing \r\n \r\nYou'll learn strategies for not only writing your plugin well, but keeping it healthy and well behaved as it evolves and new versions of Gradle are released.",

              "description": "Scaling your services is easy when your services are stateless. However, in real life applications have to deal with state - how do you scale stateful software systems and their data? This is where it may become scary - while modern storage solutions (from Etcd to Cassandra) promise to solve this problem for us, operating these solutions may be tricky. Even if you don’t have to reimplement underlying consensus algorithms (like Paxos and Raft), you still need to understand how they work to operate, debug, and scale your systems. \r\n\r\nThis talk explains the mechanics of different consensus algorithms in everyday terms. This talk is not an academic paper: instead of providing formal proofs and scientific language, it focuses on practical aspects of consensus algorithms’ usage. It explains actionable insights in (relatively) simple words without pitching a concrete approach or technology as a magic cure.",

              "description": "Every technology has that key concept that people struggle to understand. With databases, is which join clause to use for fetching data from multiple tables. Containers are tricky when you have to pick a storage type given some persistence requirements. With Apache Kafka, the winner is how many partitions to set for a topic.\r\n\r\nWhy this is important? You may ask. Well, sizing Kafka partitions wrongly affects many aspects of the system, such as storage, parallelism, and durability. Worse, it may also affect how much load Kafka can handle. Hence why often the decision about how many partitions to set for a topic is handled by Ops teams, as we see this to be only an infrastructure matter. In reality, this is an architectural design decision that affects even the amount of code you write.\r\n\r\nThis session will peel off the concept of partitions and explain it from the perspective of the Kafka cluster and its clients. It will explain the formula people should use to decide how many partitions to set for a topic, and how to spot a poor decision when they see one.",

Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3 raise their baseline to Jakarta EE 9 API level which is supported by Tomcat 10 and Jetty 11 for example.\r\n\r\nAttending this session will teach you how to make this migration as smoothly as possible.

              "title": "How to Fix Your Technical Debt Dilemma",
              "description": "When you think about 1,700 developer days (or 4.8 years of time) in the engineering world, how does that make you feel? To me, it feels like infinity. Technical debt can show up like this in an organization. It’s a backlog of issues—migrating software, cleaning up code, and fixing security vulnerabilities—that can paralyze engineering organizations and lead to burnout. And the reality of modern applications is that they naturally accrue tech debt. They are composed of large and diverse codebases and ecosystems—a supply chain of custom, third-party, and open source software. Dependencies are changing frequently and evolve at their own pace. Not updating leads to critical bugs, performance, and security issues. The key to fixing your technical debt dilemma is continuous software modernization. You’ll never get behind when maintenance work that would normally take many months of manual effort can be automated and completed with a PR in minutes. This is how developers stay energized and your business can thrive.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll introduce OpenRewrite, an open source, auto-refactoring technology that was born at Netflix in 2016. It uses sophisticated, fast code search capabilities in combination with powerful change recipes that actually fix the code. I’ll share a use case of a common issue remediation—running a recipe live that fixes the issue and executing it across 300 million lines of open source code. The recipe will be made available in open source for you to apply to your own codebase at the end of the session.\r\n\r\nKey Take-aways:\r\n\r\n* Technical debt can be reframed as continuous software modernization with robust automation that not only finds the issues, but fixes them regularly.\r\n* OpenRewrite uses a similar approach as an IDE to automate refactoring, but takes it out of single person, single repo mode, so it can be delivered in different ways. The refactoring is 100% accurate and style preserving.\r\n* You can see immediate results using the open source change recipes from OpenRewrite—just try out one recipe and get days of your time back!\r\n* Moderne has a Saas platform that works with OpenRewrite recipes to help you execute continuous software modernization at scale—across repositories simultaneously\r\n",

              "description": "When designing software systems, architects and developers have plenty of architectural options from which to choose.  Over the last few years, we have seen the growth of Microservice-based systems. However, the idea of monolithic, modular systems has recently regained popularity.  Regardless of which architecture we choose, how can we build the individual applications that comprise our overall system such that their structure is evolvable to follow business requirements?\r\nWhat if I were to tell you there was a way for you to express these logical application modules in code so that you can build well-structured, domain-aligned Spring Boot applications?  Spring Modulith does this by providing the developer a way to declare logical modules in Spring Boot applications.  It also provides the tooling needed to write Junit tests that run structural validation tests, run integration tests for individual modules, and to document the module arrangement.  It also has features that let you implement module interactions in a loosely coupled way and then lets you observe module interactions between each other at runtime.  In this talk, we discuss the features that are available and then in a live coding demonstration show you how they work.",

With serverless and FaaS models, startup time and memory footprint play a big role, as it determines the cost of deploying to the cloud. Come to this session to learn more about how technologies like checkpoint/restore and remote JIT compilation can help boost startup time and reduce memory footprint to minimize your costs. You'll also learn how these features integrate seamlessly with existing container technologies for simple, secure and predictable deployments. Whether you are a cloud veteran or a new comer, there will be lots to learn!",

This talk focuses on dividing specializations; data engineer and data scientist. \r\n\r\nThe data engineer ensures that data is delivered, manipulated, and harnessed. The data engineer does this to be useful for the data scientist. The data engineer is also versant in Java and Scala and will be knowledgeable in pub-subs like Kafka.\r\n\r\nThe data scientist uses that data, does their cleaning, and investigates possible patterns designing a machine learning model that we can use to either find regressions or classifications for our data. The data scientists use Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Tensorflow, and Matplotlib as their tools of choice for constructing a machine-learning model to make decisions about the data.\r\n\r\nThis presentation answers the question. How do we take that model and tie it to everything else? This workshop will use a wide array of technologies. It will set you on the path to running Machine Learning Pipelines in Kubernetes using Kafka and Tensorflow, so you can start immediately when you return to work.",

Software supply chain attacks are on the rise with security exploits directly targeting open source projects, central repositories, and software package managers. Now that developers are the target of security attackers, how do you protect your DevOps pipeline?\r\n\r\nThis is a problem that the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF)  is working to solve.. To help ensure a secure SDLC, the CDF is investing in projects that provide security solutions and in 2022 announced a new incubating project, Pyrsia. This talk will highlight the importance of securing your software supply chain at the source and how Pyrsia is working to solve this problem.",

Code that uses blocking APIs or performs CPU-bound operations can have a significant impact on application responsiveness. Using Worker Threads can help alleviate pressure on the event-loop, but scaling out more replicas also plays an important role.\r\n\r\nJoin this session for a practical introduction to Kubernetes autoscaling, and KEDA. We'll examine an application that suffers reduced throughput and increased latency due to CPU-bound tasks blocking the event-loop. We'll then explore how Worker Threads and autoscaling features provided by Kubernetes and KEDA can keep our application both highly-available and responsive.",

              "description": "Cloud availability zones and regions are not immune to outages. The zones go down regularly and regions become unavailable during natural disasters or human-caused incidents. Thus, if an availability zone or a larger area goes down, so does your application—unless the application can work across multiple geographic locations.\r\n\r\nCome and learn how to build resilient, geo-distributed Java apps that can withstand various cloud failures. Using Spring Cloud tools and components, you'll architect and deploy a geo-distributed Slack-like messenger that can span several continents, load balance requests across distant regions, and most importantly, tolerate various storms and outages in the cloud.",

Troubleshooting, digging through logs, editing configuration files, you name it. If you're used to working with Windows or OSX GUI's, the Linux terminal might appear fairly basic and difficult to use.\r\n\r\nBut, with some basic background knowledge and a small set of terminal commands in your toolbox, it can actually be extremely powerful and loads of fun!\r\n\r\nIn this session, I'll explain the concepts behind the Linux command line and I'll demo loads of useful stuff. You'll learn how to quickly navigate, find files, examine and search through logs, how to investigate a system under load, a bit of shell scripting, ssh tunneling and more!\r\n\r\nAt the end of this session, you'll have the chance to throw your own problems and use cases at me - I'll come up with solutions on the spot. Bring your own problems ;-)\r\n\r\nThis talk takes places entirely in the command line. No slides, no IDE, just a plain terminal window. After this session, you'll be on your way to master the Linux command line yourself!",

            "description": "The future of human machine teaming will harness the human mind in ways that were the dreams of the past's science fiction. The technology is here now but researchers are challenged to understand the incredible complexity of the human brain.\r\n\r\nFunctional brain computer interfaces are a now a nascent but rapidly accelerating field. With the physical technology becoming a reality governments, corporations and research facilities are racing to find ways to understand how the human mind can be harnessed for good.\r\n\r\nOne of the many challenges of Brain Computer Interfaces is decoding and interpreting the hyper-dimensional signals that come from a human brain's connected neurons. A critical method for understanding this decoding is visualization.\r\n\r\nThis keynote discussion will describe what makes a brain computer interface possible, how it can be utilized and what the current limitations are. A software demonstration will be provided which demonstrates receiving, organizing and visualizing decoded neuron data with dimensions well beyond 3D.  Animated visualizations will be provided which provide insight into the brain's actions and how such a technology could be used for good and the betterment of mankind in the future. ",

Add a global load balancer like Azure Front Door.  Deploy the same application to multiple regions, backed my multiple instances of ACRE connected in active-active configuration.  Learn why connecting to data in a different region is an anti-pattern. Demonstrate destroying an entire region to show the value of active-active level resilience. Using Terraform, Spring Boot and Azure.\r\n\r\nIn this session, you will learn a reference architecture, for modern, geo-distributed applications. You will learn how to modernize a single-region application, into a multiple-region or multi-cloud architecture.

            "description": "Rewriting systems from a monolithic architecture to a services architecture is a common task nowadays to make applications easier to maintain, deploy, and release. This migration should not be a big bang rewrite where you directly switch from the old application to the new one. Instead, it is an incremental process during which functionalities are extracted one at a time into separate services.\r\n \r\nThe Strangler Fig Pattern describes a method whereby a new system is slowly and incrementally growing over the top of an old system. Along the way, the whole system is continuously monitored such that old parts can be removed after the new services show correct behavior. The theory is pretty clear, and in services where no persistence is needed, it's considerably easier, but things become way more complex as soon as data is involved.\r\n \r\nCome to this session to learn how Kafka and Debezium, through Change Data Capture and the Strangler Fig pattern, can help you migrate from monoliths to a (micro)services architecture confidently even though databases are involved.\r\n",

OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them.

            "description": "As infrastructure stacks grow increasingly more complex and involve an ever-growing number of services and systems there are a lot of opportunities for error and misconfiguration. To provide more system stability teams have looked to abstract configuration to its own layer of code. This concept of configuring infrastructure as code is gaining traction throughout the industry for a variety of reasons. It's fast, consistent, reduces errors, self-documentation, and did I mention it's fast? Tools such as Terraform from HashiCorp have emerged as one of the leading ways to declaratively configure technology stacks.\r\n\r\nIn this talk you'll gain an understanding of the benefits of Infrastructure as Code in general, and of using Terraform specifically. You'll be introduced to how Terraform works, what the code looks like, and how to get started.",

We will also look at what the future might bring.\r\n\r\nJakarta EE 10 brings some long pending updates to key technologies like Jakarta Security, Concurrency, REST, Persistence and Faces. It also brings the Core Profile targeted to next-generation runtimes such as Open Liberty, Helidon and Quarkus. Down the line in Jakarta EE 11, there may be further changes afoot for Jakarta Configuration, NoSQL, Messaging, Security, Concurrency, REST, Persistence/Data, gRPC and MVC. You can contribute to all this and more.\r\n\r\nYou should come to this session with your thinking caps on and your sleeves rolled up.

Are you aware of the Fullscreen  or the GamePad API? Have an e-commerce app or an app that processes microtransactions? Does it use the PaymentRequest API? There are tons of really cool APIs that you might not be aware of. Or maybe you are aware of them, but you're just not sure how to use them to improve your application? In this session, I'll introduce you to some of the lesser known APIs that are available in most modern web browsers. I'll also show you some demos that I've created with these APIs to show you how they can actually be used to make engaging experiences that keep your users happy and keep them coming back to your site.

We now have a very precise idea of what they are and what you can do with them. Our good old Threads, created more than 25 years ago, will see a new kind of lightweight threads. This presentation shows you that creating a thread is easier and much cheaper, allowing the creation of millions of them in a single JVM. These virtual threads can be block at almost no cost. These new virtual threads bring with them new notions that will be covered in this talk. Loom threads are coming, and they will change the landscape of concurrent programming in Java.",

            "description": "Data is at the heart of most applications. For ages, Java developers have been using conditions to determine whether an instance is of a specific type - to extract its components. Though this sounds obvious and harmless, Pattern Matching has revolutionized how you achieve this in your everyday code in a concise and focused way.\r\n\r\nWorking with its syntax seems simple and straightforward. Pattern Matching can be used with operators like instanceof, and constructs like switch statements and expressions. But, don't let this simplicity deceive you. Its real power lies in understanding the semantics of working with Patterns like Type Patterns, Parenthesized Patterns, Record Patterns and others to write declarative and data-focused code to create powerful, declarative and composable data navigation and processing. \r\n\r\nIn this live-coded talk, the attendees will learn about the issues with their existing code, create concise and clear data-focused queries, and modify existing code bases to avail benefits of Pattern Matching.",

Almost three decades later, improvements in the Java language allow us to revisit most of these design patterns and propose novel ways to solve the same problems.\r\n\r\nJoin us at this talk when we perform some live refactorings of code using legacy implementations of design patterns into new code using the latest improvements of Java 20. Come and witness how Strategy, Template Method, Visitor, Command, Decorator, Builder, and other patterns can significantly benefit from modern features of Java, such as lambdas, records, switch expressions, and much more.",

            "description": "There are a variety of different attacks on the open source supply chain, including exploitation of zero day vulnerabilities, injection of malicious code or back-doors, and typo-squatting of popular libraries. And the systems that we rely upon for the distribution of OSS were not designed with a security mindset to prevent these sorts of attacks. There has to be a better way for open source authors and maintainers to securely deliver their packages to end users!\r\n\r\nEnter Pyrsia, a new software distribution system that is decentralized, community-driven, foundation governed, and built with a security first focus. In this presentation we will talk about how Pyrsia is designed, how you can use it to distribute and consume software packages, and how you can get involved in the Pyrsia community to grow the library of OSS software available freely and securely for all.",

But what if all of this could be simplified and automated pretty easily?\r\n\r\nIf we think about our production microservices operations, in the same way we think about how we design and build our products, we could build and automate minimum viable security plans that we could easily bake into our config files and CI/CD processes.  Once we build this foundational framework of security, it will always be possible to iterate and evolve our security framework, for advanced layers of security that often comes with time, increased experience, and greater maturity around security.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present what MVS looks like for microservices operations, how to build a cluster secured by design, continuously monitoring networking,  container internals and primitives, and access management with a least privilege principle mindset. In this session we will demonstrate this through code, and even how this can work seamlessly with other ecosystem projects - from Helm to OPA, ArgoCD, Notary or Github Actions, Terraform, and AWS.",

            "description": "Kubernetes makes it possible to autoscale various business use cases from web apps to mobile, IoT edge streaming, and AI/ML in more reliable and stable ways. One caveat of the Kubernetes autoscaling is based on hardware resource utilization (CPU, memory) through Horizontal Pod Autoscaling. This causes a new challenge to build an event-driven serverless Java on Kubernetes because the event metrics from multiple event sources (e.g., Apache Kafka, AWS SQS) are more relevant than a pod's CPU usage for deciding when applications need to be scaled out and in. \r\n\r\nFortunately, KEDA and Knative on Kubernetes are designed to solve this challenge by autoscaling both standard apps and serverless by event metrics in a separate way. This session will teach you how to redesign your Kubernetes autoscaling architecture by event-driven metrics from Apache Kafka over standard resources (CPU, Memory) with Knative and KEDA integration for serverless Java using Quarkus.\r\n",

But what is Knative, exactly?\r\n\r\nSimply put, Knative is a technology that streamlines and enhances the way that applications run on Kubernetes.\r\n\r\nThis talk is for people who are excited about this value proposition and want to dig deeper. How does it work? What components are at play? In what ways is running an app on Knative superior to running it directly on Kubernetes?\r\n\r\nInstead of presenting slides, Whitney will diagram the fundamental concepts of Knative, explaining how they work in simple, relatable terms. She will then drive deeper understanding with a live coding demo that gives context to the main points. With spiders and rainbows. You know, a real-life, straightforward, run-of-the-mill use case.\r\n\r\nAttend this talk to gain a high-level understanding of Knative, its main components, and how it simplifies and improves the way that apps run on Kubernetes.",

As developers, we can develop, test, and build our applications into WAR or executable JAR files and then toss them over the wall to a Java application server and Java runtime that we have no control over, giving us zero confidence that the application will behave the same as when we tested it.\r\n\r\nContainers fulfill the write-once, run anywhere promise that Java wasn't able to, by packaging the runtime and even the operating system along with our application, giving greater control and confidence that the application will function the same anywhere it is run. Additionally, containers afford several other benefits, including easy scaling, efficiency in terms of resource utilization, and security by isolating containers from their host system and from other containers.\r\n\r\nWhile deploying Spring applications in containers has always been possible, Spring Boot makes it easier to containerize our applications and run them in container architectures such as Kubernetes. Spring Boot's support for containerization includes two options: Creating containers based on buildpacks or using layers as a means of modularizing and reducing the size of our application deployments. Moreover, new components in the Spring ecosystem can make your Spring applications Kubernetes-savvy so that they can take advantage of what a containerized architecture has to offer.\r\n\r\nIn this example-driven session, we're going to look at how to create and deploy Spring applications as container images and deploy them into a Kubernetes cluster. Along the way, we'll also get to know a few of the most useful tools that a Spring developer can employ in their development workflow when building containerized Spring applications. We'll also see how to apply patterns of Spring Cloud--such as configuration, service discovery, and gateways--using native Kubernetes facilities instead of Spring Cloud components. And we'll look at how components of the Spring ecosystem can work with your Spring applications to enable them to thrive in a Kubernetes cluster.\r\n",

It provides API consumers with better visibility and more control over their data.\r\n\r\nWhere REST has endpoints and status codes, GraphQL has queries, mutations, types, and richer errors. It allows you to ask for precisely the data you need, to batch requests for parallel server processing, and even returns partial results in the face of downstream failures.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will explain our experience adopting GraphQL at New Relic. We will discuss the challenges and solutions we found - including the smaller community using GraphQL outside of the Javascript ecosystem, how we learned to think differently about the data we expose, and why you might consider adopting it yourself. We will also showcase the open-source libraries that we created to help both our own services and those of the wider community.",

But before we pack up to go home, how will we know if we deployed a bug or if our last change caused a significant performance degradation? Also how can we know when network issues arise or if one of our dependencies goes down?\r\nIn this forward-looking presentation, we will answer these questions by looking into application observability using distributed tracing, metrics, correlated logs, and exemplars. We will explore how the latest developments in Micrometer, Spring Framework 6, Spring Boot 3, Prometheus, OpenZipkin, and OpenTelemetry will give you a better understanding about what is going on inside of your applications. \r\nWe will also discuss the future of Observability in Spring Boot and other methods of exploring your running application using Spring Boot Actuator, Spring Boot Admin and Spring HATEOAS along with related technologies like Eureka, Logbook and Swagger.",

It also brings the new features Java has to offer faster, so that developers can improve applications readability, maintainability as well as development productivity. \r\nThis presentation covers three of the new features of the JDK: Amber, Loom and Valhalla. Amber is about bringing pattern matching to the Java language. It's currently added bit by bit: records, pattern matching for instanceof, for switch, and record pattern matching. Loom offers a new concurrent programming model. With Loom, you can write your code in a synchronous way, without any callback, and execute it asynchronously, with all the performances benefits you may expect. It is a preview feature of the JDK 19. Valhalla brings a new kind of objects to the language, so that you do not have to choose between performances and abstraction. Valhalla will add user defined primitive types to the Java language as well value types.",

In that case, this talk is something for you!\r\n\r\nIn this talk we’ll look at learning a new language from a Linguistic and Neurological perspective, while at the same time looking at how we can apply this in the IT setting we work in. At the end of this talk you will know how your brain stores new information and how that information can be retrieved and used. Next to that you will be given some practical tips and tricks on how to improve your own learning curve and how to help others support others who are in the process of learning.\r\n\r\nAs a previous speech-and-language therapist I would like to give you a better understanding of how we learn languages and how this knowledge can help us in the never-ending changing world of software development!",

Later releases brought a lot of improvements, bug fixes, and of course coloured output.\r\n\r\nBut the Maven community hasn’t been resting on their laurels. A lot of effort has gone into the future of Maven. You may have heard about Maven 4, Maven Wrapper, or Maven Daemon. Why should you care? And how will it change the way you use Maven? I will show you by using the latest snapshot builds of Maven - time will tell if that’s a brave or a stupid idea…\r\n\r\nJoin me to find out what the future of Maven has for you!",

You will also learn how to leverage the process to minimize the time you spend debugging -- which leaves you with more time for the fun parts.",

            "description": "The Shift Left philosophy is a product of the Agile movement. Its practices encourage teams to test and validate software as early in the process as possible. It’s been shown that the earlier issues are found and addressed that overall quality, time to delivery, and project costs improve. As teams adopt Shift Left, one notable exception is often overlooked. That is deployment. Over the past decade, application deployment has steadily become more of a software effort. The argument can easily be made that validating application deployment, which has primarily become a software effort, is just as much a candidate for Shift Left as the application itself. With containerization continuing its rise on becoming the application deployment norm, the notion of a production-like system deployed as far left in the cycle as a developer’s workstation is a practical reality. In organizations that have adopted Kubernetes, each phase of the delivery pipeline is able to accurately replicate a production environment.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will examine the benefits and challenges of Shifting Left by building and validating Kubernetes-based deployments. Topics include replicating production environments starting with development workstations, strategies for maintaining deployment code alongside application source code, considerations for artifact registries and repositories, and tooling that can assist at each stage.\r\n",

Do you find yourself wishing that you could quickly and efficiently poll your loved ones, peers, and colleagues for their pastry preferences? Look no further. This talk explores how to create an interactive, real-time survey bot with Telegram and Apache Kafka® and how to analyze the survey responses using ksqlDB.\r\n\r\nKafka Producers and Consumers are the main ingredients that come together to make an interactive Telegram bot that issues on-demand surveys to friends and family. Survey responses are written to Kafka in real-time where ksqlDB helps to measure, mix, and knead the data––serving up a fresh and delicious result that we can consume immediately! In this session, you’ll see the entire pipeline from start to finish, learning how to think about data and use schemas, how to configure Producers and Consumers, and how to use ksqlDB for both stateless and stateful processing. \r\n\r\nCome along to see how this recipe for real-time survey analysis comes together––and how you, too, can calculate the value of pie!",

The technology is here now but researchers are challenged to understand the incredible complexity of the human brain.\r\n\r\nFunctional brain computer interfaces are a now a nascent but rapidly accelerating field. With the physical technology becoming a reality governments, corporations and research facilities are racing to find ways to understand how the human mind can be harnessed for good.\r\n\r\nOne of the many challenges of Brain Computer Interfaces is decoding and interpreting the hyper-dimensional signals that come from a human brain's connected neurons. A critical method for understanding this decoding is visualization.\r\n\r\nThis keynote discussion will describe what makes a brain computer interface possible, how it can be utilized and what the current limitations are. A software demonstration will be provided which demonstrates receiving, organizing and visualizing decoded neuron data with dimensions well beyond 3D.  Animated visualizations will be provided which provide insight into the brain's actions and how such a technology could be used for good and the betterment of mankind in the future. ",

Add a global load balancer like Azure Front Door.  Deploy the same application to multiple regions, backed my multiple instances of ACRE connected in active-active configuration.  Learn why connecting to data in a different region is an anti-pattern. Demonstrate destroying an entire region to show the value of active-active level resilience.

We will also look at what the future might bring.\r\n\r\nJakarta EE 10 brings some long pending updates to key technologies like Jakarta Security, Concurrency, REST, Persistence and Faces. It also brings the Core Profile targeted to next-generation runtimes such as Open Liberty, Helidon and Quarkus. Down the line in Jakarta EE 11, there may be further changes afoot for Jakarta Configuration, NoSQL, Messaging, Security, Concurrency, REST, Persistence/Data, gRPC and MVC. You can contribute to all this and more.\r\n\r\nYou should come to this session with your thinking caps on and your sleeves rolled up. There is much to help move forward together that really matters.",

I'll talk about FAST, what it means to accessibility, and to users, developers, designers, and everyone in-between in the organization.\r\n\r\nI'll also introduce people to the Framework for Accessible Specification of Technologies (FAST) which advises creators of technical specifications on ensuring their technology meets the needs of users with disabilities. It primarily addresses web content technologies but also relates to any technology that affects web content sent to users, including client-side APIs, transmission protocols, and interchange formats. Specifications that implement these guidelines make it possible for content authors and user agents to render the content in an accessible manner to people with a wide range of abilities.",

We now have a very precise idea of what they are and what you can do with them. Our good old Threads, created more than 25 years ago, will see a new kind of lightweight threads. This presentation shows you that creating a thread is easier and much cheaper, allowing the creation of millions of them in a single JVM. These virtual threads can be block at almost no cost. These new virtual threads bring with them new notions that will be covered in this talk. Loom threads are coming, and they will change the landscape of concurrent programming in Java.",

At the end of this talk you will know how your brain stores new information and how that information can be retrieved and used. Next to that you will be given some practical tips and tricks on how to improve your own learning curve and how to help others support others who are in the process of learning.\r\n\r\nAs a previous speech-and-language therapist I would like to give you a better understanding of how we learn languages and how this knowledge can help us in the never-ending changing world of software development!",

              "description": "The Shift Left philosophy is a product of the Agile movement. Its practices encourage teams to test and validate software as early in the process as possible. It’s been shown that the earlier issues are found and addressed that overall quality, time to delivery, and project costs improve. As teams adopt Shift Left, one notable exception is often overlooked. That is deployment. Over the past decade, application deployment has steadily become more of a software effort. The argument can easily be made that validating application deployment, which has primarily become a software effort, is just as much a candidate for Shift Left as the application itself. With containerization continuing its rise on becoming the application deployment norm, the notion of a production-like system deployed as far left in the cycle as a developer’s workstation is a practical reality. In organizations that have adopted Kubernetes, each phase of the delivery pipeline is able to accurately replicate a production environment.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will examine the benefits and challenges of Shifting Left by building and validating Kubernetes-based deployments. Topics include replicating production environments starting with development workstations, strategies for maintaining deployment code alongside application source code, considerations for artifact registries and repositories, and tooling that can assist at each stage.\r\n",

              "description": "Rewriting systems from a monolithic architecture to a services architecture is a common task nowadays to make applications easier to maintain, deploy, and release. This migration should not be a big bang rewrite where you directly switch from the old application to the new one. Instead, it is an incremental process during which functionalities are extracted one at a time into separate services.\r\n \r\nThe Strangler Fig Pattern describes a method whereby a new system is slowly and incrementally growing over the top of an old system. Along the way, the whole system is continuously monitored such that old parts can be removed after the new services show correct behavior. The theory is pretty clear, and in services where no persistence is needed, it's considerably easier, but things become way more complex as soon as data is involved.\r\n \r\nCome to this session to learn how Kafka and Debezium, through Change Data Capture and the Strangler Fig pattern, can help you migrate from monoliths to a (micro)services architecture confidently even though databases are involved.\r\n",

              "description": "Although Knative has been community-maintained since 2018, there has been buzz around the project lately because Knative has recently been accepted to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as an incubating project.\r\n\r\nCool! But what is Knative, exactly?\r\n\r\nSimply put, Knative is a technology that streamlines and enhances the way that applications run on Kubernetes.\r\n\r\nThis talk is for people who are excited about this value proposition and want to dig deeper. How does it work? What components are at play? In what ways is running an app on Knative superior to running it directly on Kubernetes?\r\n\r\nInstead of presenting slides, Whitney will diagram the fundamental concepts of Knative, explaining how they work in simple, relatable terms. She will then drive deeper understanding with a live coding demo that gives context to the main points. With spiders and rainbows. You know, a real-life, straightforward, run-of-the-mill use case.\r\n\r\nAttend this talk to gain a high-level understanding of Knative, its main components, and how it simplifies and improves the way that apps run on Kubernetes.",

We will see how this library unlocks developer velocity via Spring Boot foundations when designing pub-sub solutions with Apache Pulsar . \r\n\r\nYou will witness a live demo where we create a basic Spring for Apache Pulsar app and evolve it from imperative -> reactive -> native. \r\n\r\nApache Pulsar is a cloud-native, multi-tenant, high-performance solution for server-to-server messaging and queuing built on the pub-sub pattern. Pulsar combines the best features of a traditional messaging system like RabbitMQ with those of a pub-sub system like Apache Kafka.",

There are tons of really cool APIs that you might not be aware of. Or maybe you are aware of them, but you're just not sure how to use them to improve your application? In this session, I'll introduce you to some of the lesser known APIs that are available in most modern web browsers. I'll also show you some demos that I've created with these APIs to show you how they can actually be used to make engaging experiences that keep your users happy and keep them coming back to your site.

              "description": "Since the dawn of ... the epoch?, engineers have been trying to automate away the boring, repetitive stuff.  These days thanks to the rise of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment practices, we've never had a richer set of tools.  On the flip side, it can hard to know how to wire it all up to meet your specific needs.  In this talk we'll cover some of these options using GitHub Actions and see how we can automate, and better yet reuse that automation, to make your project management one less reason to lay awake at night.  Join me as I share the lessons learned and practices developed in both my professional and personal software projects.",

              "description": "REST has become a standard for services on the internet, but it isn't without its drawbacks. GraphQL is a query language from Facebook that's caught on to address many of these issues. It provides API consumers with better visibility and more control over their data.\r\n\r\nWhere REST has endpoints and status codes, GraphQL has queries, mutations, types, and richer errors. It allows you to ask for precisely the data you need, to batch requests for parallel server processing, and even returns partial results in the face of downstream failures.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will explain our experience adopting GraphQL at New Relic. We will discuss the challenges and solutions we found - including the smaller community using GraphQL outside of the Javascript ecosystem, how we learned to think differently about the data we expose, and why you might consider adopting it yourself. We will also showcase the open-source libraries that we created to help both our own services and those of the wider community.",

Where can we find these projects or the community? In this discussion, we will show you 2 paths that you can take advantage of, so that you can give to the community and grow your career. \r\nThe first path that we will discuss is how to contribute to an open-source project. This includes the who, what, and how of open source and the places where you can contribute to an open source.   Spoilers: Anyone can contribute, and you need not be a coder to contribute. \r\nThe second path we'll discuss is Civic Hacking. We will define what it is, where to get involved and cover its basic tenets:\r\n- Do what you can?\r\n- Where you can?\r\n- With what you've got?\r\n",

Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind.\r\n\r\nObservability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.",

To provide more system stability teams have looked to abstract configuration to its own layer of code. This concept of configuring infrastructure as code is gaining traction throughout the industry for a variety of reasons. It's fast, consistent, reduces errors, self-documentation, and did I mention it's fast? Tools such as Terraform from HashiCorp have emerged as one of the leading ways to declaratively configure technology stacks.\r\n\r\nIn this talk you'll gain an understanding of the benefits of Infrastructure as Code in general, and of using Terraform specifically. You'll be introduced to how Terraform works, what the code looks like, and how to get started.",

For ages, Java developers have been using conditions to determine whether an instance is of a specific type - to extract its components. Though this sounds obvious and harmless, Pattern Matching has revolutionized how you achieve this in your everyday code in a concise and focused way.\r\n\r\nWorking with its syntax seems simple and straightforward. Pattern Matching can be used with operators like instanceof, and constructs like switch statements and expressions. But, don't let this simplicity deceive you. Its real power lies in understanding the semantics of working with Patterns like Type Patterns, Parenthesized Patterns, Record Patterns and others to write declarative and data-focused code to create powerful, declarative and composable data navigation and processing. \r\n\r\nIn this live-coded talk, the attendees will learn about the issues with their existing code, create concise and clear data-focused queries, and modify existing code bases to avail benefits of Pattern Matching.",

              "description": "Kubernetes makes it possible to autoscale various business use cases from web apps to mobile, IoT edge streaming, and AI/ML in more reliable and stable ways. One caveat of the Kubernetes autoscaling is based on hardware resource utilization (CPU, memory) through Horizontal Pod Autoscaling. This causes a new challenge to build an event-driven serverless Java on Kubernetes because the event metrics from multiple event sources (e.g., Apache Kafka, AWS SQS) are more relevant than a pod's CPU usage for deciding when applications need to be scaled out and in. \r\n\r\nFortunately, KEDA and Knative on Kubernetes are designed to solve this challenge by autoscaling both standard apps and serverless by event metrics in a separate way. This session will teach you how to redesign your Kubernetes autoscaling architecture by event-driven metrics from Apache Kafka over standard resources (CPU, Memory) with Knative and KEDA integration for serverless Java using Quarkus.\r\n",

It also brings the new features Java has to offer faster, so that developers can improve applications readability, maintainability as well as development productivity. \r\nThis presentation covers three of the new features of the JDK: Amber, Loom and Valhalla. Amber is about bringing pattern matching to the Java language. It's currently added bit by bit: records, pattern matching for instanceof, for switch, and record pattern matching. Loom offers a new concurrent programming model. With Loom, you can write your code in a synchronous way, without any callback, and execute it asynchronously, with all the performances benefits you may expect. It is a preview feature of the JDK 19. Valhalla brings a new kind of objects to the language, so that you do not have to choose between performances and abstraction. Valhalla will add user defined primitive types to the Java language as well value types.",

Do you find yourself wishing that you could quickly and efficiently poll your loved ones, peers, and colleagues for their pastry preferences? Look no further. This talk explores how to create an interactive, real-time survey bot with Telegram and Apache Kafka® and how to analyze the survey responses using ksqlDB.\r\n\r\nKafka Producers and Consumers are the main ingredients that come together to make an interactive Telegram bot that issues on-demand surveys to friends and family. Survey responses are written to Kafka in real-time where ksqlDB helps to measure, mix, and knead the data––serving up a fresh and delicious result that we can consume immediately! In this session, you’ll see the entire pipeline from start to finish, learning how to think about data and use schemas, how to configure Producers and Consumers, and how to use ksqlDB for both stateless and stateful processing. \r\n\r\nCome along to see how this recipe for real-time survey analysis comes together––and how you, too, can calculate the value of pie!",

Is a document database even the right tool? In this session we’ll go over the basics of data modeling using JSON. We’ll compare and contrast with traditional RDBMS modeling. Impact on application code will be discussed, as well as some tooling that could be helpful along the way. The examples use the free, open-source Couchbase Server document database, but the principles from this session can also be applied to CosmosDb, Mongo, RavenDb, etc.",

But what if all of this could be simplified and automated pretty easily?\r\n\r\nIf we think about our production microservices operations, in the same way we think about how we design and build our products, we could build and automate minimum viable security plans that we could easily bake into our config files and CI/CD processes.  Once we build this foundational framework of security, it will always be possible to iterate and evolve our security framework, for advanced layers of security that often comes with time, increased experience, and greater maturity around security.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present what MVS looks like for microservices operations, how to build a cluster secured by design, continuously monitoring networking,  container internals and primitives, and access management with a least privilege principle mindset. In this session we will demonstrate this through code, and even how this can work seamlessly with other ecosystem projects - from Helm to OPA, ArgoCD, Notary or Github Actions, Terraform, and AWS.",

By using tools like OpenAPI specification and generator tooling capable of leveraging it, you can leap ahead in your development by generating lots of the boilerplate code, some of your tests, and allowing multiple parallel workstreams within your team. In this session I will show you examples of how you can fast track your API and service development today!",

              "description": "Although Java originally promised write once, run anywhere, it failed to fully deliver on that promise. As developers, we can develop, test, and build our applications into WAR or executable JAR files and then toss them over the wall to a Java application server and Java runtime that we have no control over, giving us zero confidence that the application will behave the same as when we tested it.\r\n\r\nContainers fulfill the write-once, run anywhere promise that Java wasn't able to, by packaging the runtime and even the operating system along with our application, giving greater control and confidence that the application will function the same anywhere it is run. Additionally, containers afford several other benefits, including easy scaling, efficiency in terms of resource utilization, and security by isolating containers from their host system and from other containers.\r\n\r\nWhile deploying Spring applications in containers has always been possible, Spring Boot makes it easier to containerize our applications and run them in container architectures such as Kubernetes. Spring Boot's support for containerization includes two options: Creating containers based on buildpacks or using layers as a means of modularizing and reducing the size of our application deployments. Moreover, new components in the Spring ecosystem can make your Spring applications Kubernetes-savvy so that they can take advantage of what a containerized architecture has to offer.\r\n\r\nIn this example-driven session, we're going to look at how to create and deploy Spring applications as container images and deploy them into a Kubernetes cluster. Along the way, we'll also get to know a few of the most useful tools that a Spring developer can employ in their development workflow when building containerized Spring applications. We'll also see how to apply patterns of Spring Cloud--such as configuration, service discovery, and gateways--using native Kubernetes facilities instead of Spring Cloud components. And we'll look at how components of the Spring ecosystem can work with your Spring applications to enable them to thrive in a Kubernetes cluster.\r\n",

But before we pack up to go home, how will we know if we deployed a bug or if our last change caused a significant performance degradation? Also how can we know when network issues arise or if one of our dependencies goes down?\r\nIn this forward-looking presentation, we will answer these questions by looking into application observability using distributed tracing, metrics, correlated logs, and exemplars. We will explore how the latest developments in Micrometer, Spring Framework 6, Spring Boot 3, Prometheus, OpenZipkin, and OpenTelemetry will give you a better understanding about what is going on inside of your applications. \r\nWe will also discuss the future of Observability in Spring Boot and other methods of exploring your running application using Spring Boot Actuator, Spring Boot Admin and Spring HATEOAS along with related technologies like Eureka, Logbook and Swagger.",
