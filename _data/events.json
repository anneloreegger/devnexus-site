        "description": "There are a variety of different attacks on the open source supply chain, including exploitation of zero day vulnerabilities, injection of malicious code or back-doors, and typo-squatting of popular libraries. And the systems that we rely upon for the distribution of OSS were not designed with a security mindset to prevent these sorts of attacks. There has to be a better way for open source authors and maintainers to securely deliver their packages to end users!\r\n\r\nEnter Pyrsia, a new software distribution system that is decentralized, community-driven, foundation governed, and built with a security first focus. In this presentation we will talk about how Pyrsia is designed, how you can use it to distribute and consume software packages, and how you can get involved in the Pyrsia community to grow the library of OSS software available freely and securely for all.",

Non-blocking code, on the other hand, could be used to increase application throughput. This is why non-blocking code is recommended in many scenarios. Over the last two decades, many approaches have been introduced to writing code that does not block.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will look into those options that are available to us. To begin, I’ll go over the evolution of the Java concurrency model since its inception with the vanilla thread. Then I will introduce Future/Callable, and CompletableFuture, briefly go over reactive programming, and finally conclude with the Project Loom that was added in Java 19.",

        "title": "Beginners guide to balance your data across Apache Kafka partitions",
        "description": "Apache Kafka is a distributed system. At the heart of Apache Kafka is a set of brokers, which allow to store the records persistently across different topics. Topics, in turn, are split into partitions. Dividing topics into such pieces allows us to use data from multiple partitions in parallel, so that producers and consumers can work with data simultaneously and achieve higher data throughput.\r\n\r\nSuch parallelization is the key to a performant cluster, however it comes with a price. The thing is, reading from multiple partitions will eventually mess up the order of records, meaning  that the resulting order will be different from when the data was pushed into the cluster. \r\n\r\nThis happens because when consuming data from multiple partitions, the order of partitions is not guaranteed. Instead, we must rely on the order of the records within a single partition, where the data is guaranteed to maintain the original sequence. We need to use this characteristic of Apache Kafka to our advantage in those cases where the ordering of the records is important for our system.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when building our product architecture we should carefully weigh up how we will balance records across partitions and what mechanisms we will use to ensure that the sequence of the messages remains correct when data is read by multiple consumers. And even more importantly, how to achieve this and still maintain good performance.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll discuss mechanisms you can use to balance your data, such as keys and custom partitioners, but also practices that will help you to balance data evenly and produce and consume data efficiently.\r\n\r\nIf you are fresh to Apache Kafka, or you're looking for good practices to design your partitions and avoid common pitfalls, you'll find this session useful!",

        "description": "These days, it’s difficult to keep up with friends and family, even more so when important things are involved––like pie. Do you find yourself wishing that you could quickly and efficiently poll your loved ones, peers, and colleagues for their pastry preferences? Look no further. This talk explores how to create an interactive, real-time survey bot with Telegram and Apache Kafka® and how to analyze the survey responses using ksqlDB.\r\n\r\nKafka Producers and Consumers are the main ingredients that come together to make an interactive Telegram bot that issues on-demand surveys to friends and family. Survey responses are written to Kafka in real-time where ksqlDB helps to measure, mix, and knead the data––serving up a fresh and delicious result that we can consume immediately! In this session, you’ll see the entire pipeline from start to finish, learning how to think about data and use schemas, how to configure Producers and Consumers, and how to use ksqlDB for both stateless and stateful processing. \r\n\r\nCome along to see how this recipe for real-time survey analysis comes together––and how you, too, can calculate the value of pie!",

Over time, we usually master or improve upon these processes with practice. Let’s apply these two concepts;  a cooking recipe and hands-on coding experience, to learn more about Java’s Future and CompletableFuture API, important \"utensils\" to cater to asynchronous or non-blocking needs in Java.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll walk through centuries old Indian recipe ‘Paneer Tikka Masala’- a dish cherished by folk across the globe. In the talk, we’ll draw a parallel between the challenges of our recipe’s parts which involve asynchronicity and non-blocking activities, and how Java's APIs can address them in similar situations in your application code.\r\n\r\nLearning these concepts using Coding Katas, together we will fix failing code, hands-on, and learn how to work with Java’s CompletableFuture. By following a trail of TODOs and HINTs in the code, and an accompanying README, all integrated in the same project, you’ll experience the code, rather than just watching a deck, in an Integrated Development Environment!\r\n\r\nIf you are a library or an API author, this talk may inspire you to create Code Katas to help others understand and correctly use your libraries/API.\r\n\r\nWith this session you’ll learn how to make Paneer Tikka Masala and while learning new or better ways to use Java asynchronous and non-blocking APIs.",

        "description": "Data is at the heart of most applications. For ages, Java developers have been using conditions to determine whether an instance is of a specific type - to extract its components. Though this sounds obvious and harmless, Pattern Matching has revolutionized how you achieve this in your everyday code in a concise and focused way.\r\n\r\nWorking with its syntax seems simple and straightforward. Pattern Matching can be used with operators like instanceof, and constructs like switch statements and expressions. But, don't let this simplicity deceive you. Its real power lies in understanding the semantics of working with Patterns like Type Patterns, Parenthesized Patterns, Record Patterns and others to write declarative and data-focused code to create powerful, declarative and composable data navigation and processing. \r\n\r\nIn this live-coded talk, the attendees will learn about the issues with their existing code, create concise and clear data-focused queries, and modify existing code bases to avail benefits of Pattern Matching.",

However, in real life applications have to deal with state - how do you scale stateful software systems and their data? This is where it may become scary - while modern storage solutions (from Etcd to Cassandra) promise to solve this problem for us, operating these solutions may be tricky. Even if you don’t have to reimplement underlying consensus algorithms (like Paxos and Raft), you still need to understand how they work to operate, debug, and scale your systems. \r\n\r\nThis talk explains the mechanics of different consensus algorithms in everyday terms. This talk is not an academic paper: instead of providing formal proofs and scientific language, it focuses on practical aspects of consensus algorithms’ usage. It explains actionable insights in (relatively) simple words without pitching a concrete approach or technology as a magic cure.",

        "description": "Are you in the process of modernizing your business from a monolith to an agile micro-service oriented model in the cloud? Or is your application already cloud-native? There are different performance concerns that need to be taken into account when deploying to the cloud in comparison to traditional deployments. With serverless and FaaS models, startup time and memory footprint play a big role, as it determines the cost of deploying to the cloud. Come to this session to learn more about how technologies like checkpoint/restore and remote JIT compilation can help boost startup time and reduce memory footprint to minimize your costs. You'll also learn how these features integrate seamlessly with existing container technologies for simple, secure and predictable deployments. Whether you are a cloud veteran or a new comer, there will be lots to learn!",

And “doing something open source” is definitely no guarantee for success. There are numerous ways in which you can use open-source software and be worse off than if you did not.\r\n\r\nJoin me in this talk to find out how not to leverage open-source software in your organisation and your projects. Find out why reading the documentation may not always be your best bet, or how a workaround may eventually work against you. By investigating 5 ways in which you can fail, we can learn valuable lessons on what to do instead.",

It also brings the new features Java has to offer faster, so that developers can improve applications readability, maintainability as well as development productivity. \r\nThis presentation covers three of the new features of the JDK: Amber, Loom and Valhalla. Amber is about bringing pattern matching to the Java language. It's currently added bit by bit: records, pattern matching for instanceof, for switch, and record pattern matching. Loom offers a new concurrent programming model. With Loom, you can write your code in a synchronous way, without any callback, and execute it asynchronously, with all the performances benefits you may expect. It is a preview feature of the JDK 19. Valhalla brings a new kind of objects to the language, so that you do not have to choose between performances and abstraction. Valhalla will add user defined primitive types to the Java language as well value types.",

This migration should not be a big bang rewrite where you directly switch from the old application to the new one. Instead, it is an incremental process during which functionalities are extracted one at a time into separate services.\r\n \r\nThe Strangler Fig Pattern describes a method whereby a new system is slowly and incrementally growing over the top of an old system. Along the way, the whole system is continuously monitored such that old parts can be removed after the new services show correct behavior. The theory is pretty clear, and in services where no persistence is needed, it's considerably easier, but things become way more complex as soon as data is involved.\r\n \r\nCome to this session to learn how Kafka and Debezium, through Change Data Capture and the Strangler Fig pattern, can help you migrate from monoliths to a (micro)services architecture confidently even though databases are involved.\r\n",

Unfortunately, most programmers find it difficult to adopt the TDD process as it is usually taught. But, what if there was an easier way?\r\nIn this session, you will learn how to avoid the limitations caused by the way TDD is usually taught, and how to avoid the most common problems developers have with writing automated tests. You will also learn how to leverage the process to minimize the time you spend debugging -- which leaves you with more time for the fun parts.",

GraphQL is a query language from Facebook that's caught on to address many of these issues. It provides API consumers with better visibility and more control over their data.\r\n\r\nWhere REST has endpoints and status codes, GraphQL has queries, mutations, types, and richer errors. It allows you to ask for precisely the data you need, to batch requests for parallel server processing, and even returns partial results in the face of downstream failures.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will explain our experience adopting GraphQL at New Relic. We will discuss the challenges and solutions we found - including the smaller community using GraphQL outside of the Javascript ecosystem, how we learned to think differently about the data we expose, and why you might consider adopting it yourself. We will also showcase the open-source libraries that we created to help both our own services and those of the wider community.",

In order for businesses to be competitive, they need to build resilient, scalable systems that can efficiently tap into and react to this ever-increasing volume of data. \r\n\r\nEnter: streaming data pipelines. Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform that allows you to move and transform data in real-time. Throughout this workshop, you’ll build up a solid foundation and understanding of Kafka, learning the basic building blocks of the technology, its components, as well as how to produce and consume data. From there, you’ll get hands-on experience ingesting data from external systems into Kafka using Kafka Connect, joining and transforming Kafka data in real-time with ksqlDB stream processing, and using Kafka Connect to move data to downstream systems.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the workshop, you'll understand the value of real-time data and have everything you need to start building your own streaming data pipeline.\r\n\r\nNote: This workshop will utilize a free Confluent Cloud account for hosting Kafka clusters, stream processing, and schema registry. Participants require some programming knowledge.",

The technology is here now but researchers are challenged to understand the incredible complexity of the human brain.\r\n\r\nFunctional brain computer interfaces are a now a nascent but rapidly accelerating field. With the physical technology becoming a reality governments, corporations and research facilities are racing to find ways to understand how the human mind can be harnessed for good.\r\n\r\nOne of the many challenges of Brain Computer Interfaces is decoding and interpreting the hyper-dimensional signals that come from a human brain's connected neurons. A critical method for understanding this decoding is visualization.\r\n\r\nThis keynote discussion will describe what makes a brain computer interface possible, how it can be utilized and what the current limitations are. A software demonstration will be provided which demonstrates receiving, organizing and visualizing decoded neuron data with dimensions well beyond 3D.  Animated visualizations will be provided which provide insight into the brain's actions and how such a technology could be used for good and the betterment of mankind in the future. ",

We will see how this library unlocks developer velocity via Spring Boot foundations when designing pub-sub solutions with Apache Pulsar . \r\n\r\nYou will witness a live demo where we create a basic Spring for Apache Pulsar app and evolve it from imperative -> reactive -> native. \r\n\r\nApache Pulsar is a cloud-native, multi-tenant, high-performance solution for server-to-server messaging and queuing built on the pub-sub pattern. Pulsar combines the best features of a traditional messaging system like RabbitMQ with those of a pub-sub system like Apache Kafka.",

Is a document database even the right tool? In this session we’ll go over the basics of data modeling using JSON. We’ll compare and contrast with traditional RDBMS modeling. Impact on application code will be discussed, as well as some tooling that could be helpful along the way. The examples use the free, open-source Couchbase Server document database, but the principles from this session can also be applied to CosmosDb, Mongo, RavenDb, etc.",

But what is Knative, exactly?\r\n\r\nSimply put, Knative is a technology that streamlines and enhances the way that applications run on Kubernetes.\r\n\r\nThis talk is for people who are excited about this value proposition and want to dig deeper. How does it work? What components are at play? In what ways is running an app on Knative superior to running it directly on Kubernetes?\r\n\r\nInstead of presenting slides, Whitney will diagram the fundamental concepts of Knative, explaining how they work in simple, relatable terms. She will then drive deeper understanding with a live coding demo that gives context to the main points. With spiders and rainbows. You know, a real-life, straightforward, run-of-the-mill use case.\r\n\r\nAttend this talk to gain a high-level understanding of Knative, its main components, and how it simplifies and improves the way that apps run on Kubernetes.",

        "description": "Although Java originally promised write once, run anywhere, it failed to fully deliver on that promise. As developers, we can develop, test, and build our applications into WAR or executable JAR files and then toss them over the wall to a Java application server and Java runtime that we have no control over, giving us zero confidence that the application will behave the same as when we tested it.\r\n\r\nContainers fulfill the write-once, run anywhere promise that Java wasn't able to, by packaging the runtime and even the operating system along with our application, giving greater control and confidence that the application will function the same anywhere it is run. Additionally, containers afford several other benefits, including easy scaling, efficiency in terms of resource utilization, and security by isolating containers from their host system and from other containers.\r\n\r\nWhile deploying Spring applications in containers has always been possible, Spring Boot makes it easier to containerize our applications and run them in container architectures such as Kubernetes. Spring Boot's support for containerization includes two options: Creating containers based on buildpacks or using layers as a means of modularizing and reducing the size of our application deployments. Moreover, new components in the Spring ecosystem can make your Spring applications Kubernetes-savvy so that they can take advantage of what a containerized architecture has to offer.\r\n\r\nIn this example-driven session, we're going to look at how to create and deploy Spring applications as container images and deploy them into a Kubernetes cluster. Along the way, we'll also get to know a few of the most useful tools that a Spring developer can employ in their development workflow when building containerized Spring applications. We'll also see how to apply patterns of Spring Cloud--such as configuration, service discovery, and gateways--using native Kubernetes facilities instead of Spring Cloud components. And we'll look at how components of the Spring ecosystem can work with your Spring applications to enable them to thrive in a Kubernetes cluster.\r\n",

        "description": "So-called \"serverless\" may be the least accurate tech name in history, although there are countless worthy contenders for that (dis)honor. And while functions may not have a perfectly precise definition in terms of size or scope, we're far more likely to reach general agreement on functions - their purpose, scope, pros/cons, and utility - than we are to ever locate those missing servers. :)\r\n\r\nIn this session, the presenter examines what makes a capability or set of capabilities ideal candidate(s) for development and deployment as one or more functions. The presenter will then lead attendees on a Live Coding Adventure(TM) to demonstrate how to create candidate functions using the power of Spring Boot and Spring Cloud Function. Finally, we will deploy these open source functions via Azure Functions to demonstrate how to integrate everything in the cloud and reveal some potentially very welcome discoveries. Come to this session to learn how to incorporate functions into your critical systems. With great power...",

We now have a very precise idea of what they are and what you can do with them. Our good old Threads, created more than 25 years ago, will see a new kind of lightweight threads. This presentation shows you that creating a thread is easier and much cheaper, allowing the creation of millions of them in a single JVM. These virtual threads can be block at almost no cost. These new virtual threads bring with them new notions that will be covered in this talk. Loom threads are coming, and they will change the landscape of concurrent programming in Java.",

Troubleshooting, digging through logs, editing configuration files, you name it. If you're used to working with Windows or OSX GUI's, the Linux terminal might appear fairly basic and difficult to use.\r\n\r\nBut, with some basic background knowledge and a small set of terminal commands in your toolbox, it can actually be extremely powerful and loads of fun!\r\n\r\nIn this session, I'll explain the concepts behind the Linux command line and I'll demo loads of useful stuff. You'll learn how to quickly navigate, find files, examine and search through logs, how to investigate a system under load, a bit of shell scripting, ssh tunneling and more!\r\n\r\nAt the end of this session, you'll have the chance to throw your own problems and use cases at me - I'll come up with solutions on the spot. Bring your own problems ;-)\r\n\r\nThis talk takes places entirely in the command line. No slides, no IDE, just a plain terminal window.

But what if all of this could be simplified and automated pretty easily?\r\n\r\nIf we think about our production microservices operations, in the same way we think about how we design and build our products, we could build and automate minimum viable security plans that we could easily bake into our config files and CI/CD processes.  Once we build this foundational framework of security, it will always be possible to iterate and evolve our security framework, for advanced layers of security that often comes with time, increased experience, and greater maturity around security.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present what MVS looks like for microservices operations, how to build a cluster secured by design, continuously monitoring networking,  container internals and primitives, and access management with a least privilege principle mindset. In this session we will demonstrate this through code, and even how this can work seamlessly with other ecosystem projects - from Helm to OPA, ArgoCD, Notary or Github Actions, Terraform, and AWS.",

        "description": "As applications move to containers and migrate to the cloud, they become ever more complex, and it's increasingly important to monitor, analyze, and diagnose their behaviour. Observability is a new way of thinking about monitoring and understanding your applications. It’s supported by a growing range of open source tools and standards - part of the new wave of technologies that modern developers need to go fully Cloud Native.\r\n\r\nJoin Ben Evans to get the state of the fundamentals of Observability in 2023. You'll learn how to achieve observability in Java using OpenTelemetry, the emerging Open Standard for Observability, and we'll meet several other related OSS libraries and tools (such as Jaeger) along the way.",

To provide more system stability teams have looked to abstract configuration to its own layer of code. This concept of configuring infrastructure as code is gaining traction throughout the industry for a variety of reasons. It's fast, consistent, reduces errors, self-documentation, and did I mention it's fast? Tools such as Terraform from HashiCorp have emerged as one of the leading ways to declaratively configure technology stacks.\r\n\r\nIn this talk you'll gain an understanding of the benefits of Infrastructure as Code in general, and of using Terraform specifically. You'll be introduced to how Terraform works, what the code looks like, and how to get started.",

        "description": "Initially, getting Java to run on Kubernetes may seem complicated, but after a few lines of YAML and a bit of work with Docker, you will wonder what all that fuss was. It is easy! Then you start looking at the performance of your Java app in one core, one GB of memory container, and this is when it all very quickly gets murky. Ops, SREs, and Java developers need to be aware of the JVM's inner works when deciding on how to resource their applications. Without this knowledge, it isn't easy to know whether it is best to scale vertically or horizontally for performance and costs. This talk will explore JVM ergonomics, CPU throttling, Garbage Collectors, and how using this knowledge can help you increase performance while reducing costs in the cloud.",

Software supply chain attacks are on the rise with security exploits directly targeting open source projects, central repositories, and software package managers. Now that developers are the target of security attackers, how do you protect your DevOps pipeline?\r\n\r\nThis is a problem that the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF)  is working to solve.. To help ensure a secure SDLC, the CDF is investing in projects that provide security solutions and in 2022 announced a new incubating project, Pyrsia. This talk will highlight the importance of securing your software supply chain at the source and how Pyrsia is working to solve this problem.",

        "description": "The Shift Left philosophy is a product of the Agile movement. Its practices encourage teams to test and validate software as early in the process as possible. It’s been shown that the earlier issues are found and addressed that overall quality, time to delivery, and project costs improve. As teams adopt Shift Left, one notable exception is often overlooked. That is deployment. Over the past decade, application deployment has steadily become more of a software effort. The argument can easily be made that validating application deployment, which has primarily become a software effort, is just as much a candidate for Shift Left as the application itself. With containerization continuing its rise on becoming the application deployment norm, the notion of a production-like system deployed as far left in the cycle as a developer’s workstation is a practical reality. In organizations that have adopted Kubernetes, each phase of the delivery pipeline is able to accurately replicate a production environment.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will examine the benefits and challenges of Shifting Left by building and validating Kubernetes-based deployments. Topics include replicating production environments starting with development workstations, strategies for maintaining deployment code alongside application source code, considerations for artifact registries and repositories, and tooling that can assist at each stage.\r\n",

In this \"state of the union\" session (50/50 presentation/live-code), Glenn will discuss and demonstrate the current features, the recent changes and enhancements, and talk about what's coming in the future.",

        "description": "When designing software systems, architects and developers have plenty of architectural options from which to choose.  Over the last few years, we have seen the growth of Microservice-based systems. However, the idea of monolithic, modular systems has recently regained popularity.  Regardless of which architecture we choose, how can we build the individual applications that comprise our overall system such that their structure is evolvable to follow business requirements?\r\nWhat if I were to tell you there was a way for you to express these logical application modules in code so that you can build well-structured, domain-aligned Spring Boot applications?  Spring Modulith does this by providing the developer a way to declare logical modules in Spring Boot applications.  It also provides the tooling needed to write Junit tests that run structural validation tests, run integration tests for individual modules, and to document the module arrangement.  It also has features that let you implement module interactions in a loosely coupled way and then lets you observe module interactions between each other at runtime.  In this talk, we discuss the features that are available and then in a live coding demonstration show you how they work.",

        "description": "Adaptive, just in time (JIT) compilation provides a massive performance improvement to JVM-based applications compared to only using an interpreter.  The downside of this is that applications have to compile frequently used methods as the application is running.  This can lead to reduced throughput and slower response times.  Another drawback is that each time an application is started, it must perform the same analysis to identify hot spot methods and compile them.\r\n\r\nWhen running an application in the cloud, the elastic nature of resources provides the ability to change and improve the dynamics of how the JIT compiler works.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll look at Azul's work to move the JIT compiler into a centralized service that can be shared by many JVMs.  This provides many advantages, such as caching compiled code for instant delivery when restarting the same application or spinning up new instances of the same service.  In addition, it removes the workload from individual JVMs, allowing them to deliver more transactions per second of application work.  Finally, there is the opportunity to apply considerably more compute resources to enable complex optimizations to be used that wouldn't be practical in a single JVM.\r\n",

        "description": "Every technology has that key concept that people struggle to understand. With databases, is which join clause to use for fetching data from multiple tables. Containers are tricky when you have to pick a storage type given some persistence requirements. With Apache Kafka, the winner is how many partitions to set for a topic.\r\n\r\nWhy this is important? You may ask. Well, sizing Kafka partitions wrongly affects many aspects of the system, such as storage, parallelism, and durability. Worse, it may also affect how much load Kafka can handle. Hence why often the decision about how many partitions to set for a topic is handled by Ops teams, as we see this to be only an infrastructure matter. In reality, this is an architectural design decision that affects even the amount of code you write.\r\n\r\nThis session will peel off the concept of partitions and explain it from the perspective of the Kafka cluster and its clients. It will explain the formula people should use to decide how many partitions to set for a topic, and how to spot a poor decision when they see one.",

Also how can we know when network issues arise or if one of our dependencies goes down?\r\nIn this forward-looking presentation, we will answer these questions by looking into application observability using distributed tracing, metrics, correlated logs, and exemplars. We will explore how the latest developments in Micrometer, Spring Framework 6, Spring Boot 3, Prometheus, OpenZipkin, and OpenTelemetry will give you a better understanding about what is going on inside of your applications. \r\nWe will also discuss the future of Observability in Spring Boot and other methods of exploring your running application using Spring Boot Actuator, Spring Boot Admin and Spring HATEOAS along with related technologies like Eureka, Logbook and Swagger.",

It's easy to find one or more plugins that implement desired functionality, however, it's hugely disappointing when a plugin provides an awesome capability, but wreaks havoc on the performance of the build, creates undesirable side effects, or doesn't work with a certain version of Gradle.  If only every Gradle plugin was written and tested well.\r\n\r\nThis talk is intended for Gradle plugin authors who want to learn how to write plugins that consumers will love to use.  We'll explore the following concerns by looking at an example plugin and discussing ways to improve it:\r\n\r\n- Plugin architecture\r\n- Task configuration avoidance\r\n- Configuration cache compatibility\r\n- Planning for and testing with the build cache\r\n- Backwards compatibility testing \r\n \r\nYou'll learn strategies for not only writing your plugin well, but keeping it healthy and well behaved as it evolves and new versions of Gradle are released.",
