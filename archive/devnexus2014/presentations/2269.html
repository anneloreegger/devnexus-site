				<p>It&rsquo;s true! I&rsquo;ve pair programmed eight hours per day, five days per week, about 50 weeks per year for the last 13 1/2 years. For the past three and a half years I&rsquo;ve even <em>remote pair programmed</em> from my home office full time.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve given presentations at many conferences, meetups, and companies on topics ranging from Agile team management to Android messaging frameworks. Once I inevitably mention that I pair program full time and the presentation grinds to a screeching halt as I&rsquo;m peppered with questions about pair programming, regardless of my actual presentation topic.</p><p>Fine! <strong><em>Let&rsquo;s do this thing.</em></strong> What is pair programming? Why doesn&rsquo;t pair programming make software cost twice as much or take twice as long to develop? Do I pair with the same person every day? Who owns the code? How do performance reviews work? What do I do if my pair is sick? What do I do if I hate my pair? What if my pair is as dumb as a rock?</p><p>What if my pair smells bad? What if my pair smells GOOD?!</p><p>I&rsquo;ll answer any and all questions about pair programming and remote pair programming, from the poignant to the silly. I have no doubt that we can fill the allotted time with sage advice, educational anecdotes, and your own stories about pair programming.</p><p><strong><em>Ask me anything!</em></strong></p>
