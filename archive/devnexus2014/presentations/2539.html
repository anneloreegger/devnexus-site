				<p>Have you been wanting to try out some functional techniques in your codebase but don&rsquo;t know how to implement them in Java? Or has the challenge of refactoring from an imperative design to a more functional design proven too daunting of a task until now? Is it difficult to even know where to start?</p><p>This talk intends to address these challenges both by <strong>contrasting</strong> canonical imperative programming approaches with functional ones, and by <strong>demonstrating</strong> refactoring techniques that can aid in transmuting imperative code into functionally-inspired code.</p><p>Some things to expect in this talk:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a very brief overview of some key driving motivators behind FP</li>
  <li>some Ideas around leveraging the strengths of OOP and FP in the same codebase</li>
  <li>a foray into functional iteration patterns and a way to implement them in Java (folds, filters, transforms)</li>
  <li>live demonstrations of refactoring towards those functional representations of imperative designs</li>
  <li>notable performance implications of demonstrated functional approaches</li>
  <li>audience participation in whatever form that naturally takes (questions, suggestions, example problems, collaborative coding)</li>
</ul><p>Some things <strong>not</strong> to expect in this talk:</p>
<ul>
  <li>protracted academic conversations about why to use <em>Clojure over Scala over Java over C over paper and pen</em></li>
  <li>nazis</li>
  <li>death rays</li>
  <li>other things that cause us pain and/or death</li>
</ul><p>In the interest of objectivity (and self-preservation), I will attempt to avoid making dogmatic statements like &ldquo;of course chocolate is better than vanilla! Communist!&rdquo; and other peripheral problematic faux pas. (In case I fail and do it anyway&hellip;well, my bad.)</p>
