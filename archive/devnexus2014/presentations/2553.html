				<p>Refactoring is a fundamental practice for an agile developer. Each refactoring is a small and isolated activity, but the value comes when you perform a sequence of refactorings to effect larger changes. This workshop will guide participants through hands-on exercises designed to teach three essential skills to become good at refactoring:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Identifying what needs refactoring: what makes code smell, confusing, or complex?</li>
  <li>Identifying the end goal: what are the design options and which one will yield the best results?</li>
  <li>Tracing a strategy to get the code from 1 to 2.</li>
</ol><p>For the workshop, developers should bring their laptop with a basic working Java environment (JDK 1.6+, Eclipse or IntelliJ), have some knowledge about automated testing (JUnit) and refactorings, and optionally spend some time getting familiar with the code base we will use in the workshop <a href="http://git.io/9bm1IA">here</a>.</p><p>This workshop has been presented at Agile Brazil 2013, as well as internally at ThoughtWorks.</p><p>The workshop is co-presented with Mariana Bravo.</p>
