				<p>This is not your grandfather&rsquo;s Java ME. Deep dive and demonstration on the new Java SE Embedded support for ARM processors. We will demonstrate the full power of Java SE 8 running on consumer tablets (iOS/Android), embedded devices such as Raspberry Pi and PandaBoard, and the new Lego Mindstorms EV3, all of which use low power ARM chips. See end-to-end coding on devices, discuss coding practices for building performant applications, and get the low down on what is supported and what is not.</p><p><a href="http://devnexus.com/s/devnexus2014/speakers#Jim_Weaver">Jim Weaver</a> is co-presenting this session.</p>
