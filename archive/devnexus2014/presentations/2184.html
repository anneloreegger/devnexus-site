				<p>Rapidly crunching terabytes of big data requires complex technology and tremendous IT investment. Organizations of all sizes are looking for alternatives to the existing world of on-premise database technology and looking to the cloud and “big data” technologies to deal with the explosion of data types and volumes available in their organizations. </p><p>Over the years, Google has been an innovator in processing and analyzing massive amounts of information. Google has been responsible for inventing and developing many of the technologies that have been adopted by the IT industry to solve “big data” and computationally intensive problems. </p><p>Google’s Big Data and Cloud Platform Expert James Chittenden will examine in depth, what it takes to succeed in deriving business value out of Big Data. We&rsquo;ll dive into Google&rsquo;s Big Data stack (BigQuery, Compute Engine + Hadoop, Building Big Data Pipelines, etc) as well as explore best practices when harnessing Google’s massive infrastructure in supporting those efforts.</p>
