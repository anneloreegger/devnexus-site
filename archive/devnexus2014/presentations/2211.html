				<p>Today’s QA organizations often have sizable investments in test automation. Unfortunately running and maintaining your test suites represents a sizable investment. Far too often this hard work is abandoned and teams revert to a more costly, but familiar, manual approach.</p><p>A more practical solution is to integrate your test automation suites with a concept called “continuous integration”. A CI system monitors your source code and compiles the system after every change. Once the build is complete, test suites are automatically run. This approach of ongoing test execution provides your developers rapid feedback and keeps your tests in constant use. It also frees your testers up for more involved exploratory testing.</p><p>Jared shows how to set up an open source continuous integration tool and explains the best way for you to introduce this technique to your developers and testers. The concepts are simple when presented properly and provide solid benefits to all areas of an organization.</p>
