				<p>When I got into Java I had a Wow, look how easy it is to implement these patterns moment. When I got into Groovy, I had the same reaction, but only better. The dynamic nature of Groovy makes it easier to implement some common patterns. What is better, there are some patterns that you can exploit in Groovy that are not so easy in Java. In this section, you will learn how to implement some traditional patterns in Groovy, and also other patterns you are simply not used to in Java. This presentation will go far beyond the Gang-of-four (GOF) patterns. You will learn how to implement some GOF patterns, but also some patterns that will allow you to exploit dynamic nature of Groovy and the elegance of Groovy closures.</p>
