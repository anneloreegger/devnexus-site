				<p>Out-of-the-box, Hibernate ORM offers limited overhead and decent throughput. Early-stage applications enjoy the convenience of ORM/JPA with great performance. However, scaling your application into an enterprise-level system introduces more demanding needs.</p><p>This talk will describe numerous tips and techniques to both increase Hibernate ORM performance, as well as decrease overhead. These include some basic tricks, such as mapping and fetching strategies. More complex considerations, Entity enhancement instrumentation, third-party second level caching, Hibernate Search, and other considerations will also be discussed. The talk will include live demonstrations of each technique and its before-and-after results.</p>
