				<p>Just released Vaadin 7.2 is the latest edition of the popular web framework that makes it possible to write HTML5 apps in Java. In this presentation we discuss three features in detail: Hybrid grid, parametrized themes and transparent server push already introduced in earlier Vaadin 7.1.</p><p>Fully redesigned data grid component works both on the server-side as well as on the client-side using GWT. The goal has been to bring in the best data-grid component in any web framework and make it highly customizable. It supports everything between lazy loading, hierarchies, customizable data source cache strategies and lightweight cell rendering. Design and application possibilities are discussed in detail.</p><p>Newly introduced parametrized theme allows one to build look and feels from Metro to Eclipse in one SASS based theme. Use of theme as a basis for your own applications is demonstrated and examples for what can be achieved are looked into.</p><p>Vaadin 7.1 introduced automated server-push that would allow use of websockets and http streaming just by adding one @Push annotation. This is demonstrated and built in RPC and state synchronization communications are discussed.</p><p>It is assumed that you know something about Vaadin before the session. Diving into the latest big features in Vaadin allows one to learn about the direction of developing web apps in Java.</p>
