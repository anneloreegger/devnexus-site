				<p>Agile software practices are very popular with Scrum being the more favored methodology, but there is a new kid on the block pressing to become a favored process that is Kanban from the Lean mindset. This talk does a compare and contrast of Lean and Agile as well as Kanban and Scrum. The talk will explain how a team can implement either Kanban or Scrum and how you could move from Scrum to Kanban and why a team or organization might desire to make the change to Lean/Kanban.</p>
