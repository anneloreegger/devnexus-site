				<p>Hibernate has always revolved around data, ORM, and JPA. However, itâ€™s much more than that. Hibernate has grown into a family of projects and capabilities, extending well beyond the traditional ORM/JPA space.</p><p>This talk will present powerful features provided both by Hibernate ORM, as well as third-party extensions. Some capabilities are brand new, while others are older-but-improved. Topics include multiple-tenancy, geographic data, auditing/versioning, sharding, OSGi, and integration with additional Hibernate projects. The talk will include live demonstrations of each feature.</p>
