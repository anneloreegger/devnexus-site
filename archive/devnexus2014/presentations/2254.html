				<p>Git is not just a version control system. Git can change the way you interact with your team members. Lot&rsquo;s of teams don&rsquo;t think about reflecting their development workflow in Git and just use it out-of-the-box. Git, however, can be much more powerful, giving your team a boost in productivity, protecting your delivery pipeline and helping you to work better together.<br/>In this session we will start with a central workflow that is used by a lot of Subversion teams. You will learn how to practically integrate ALM solutions like continuous deployment, code reviews, change tracking and much more into your individual workflow. You will find out how to protect your master branch from accidental commits, broken builds and unreviewed code. This presentation will help you discover the best way to work together as a team - whether you&rsquo;re yet to migrate to Git or even an experienced Git user.</p>
