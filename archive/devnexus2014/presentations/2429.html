				<p>Viral videos are nothing new. However, the ability to analyze the traffic they generate and gather meaningful information is new to most enterprises. In this talk, we&rsquo;ll look at a viral video (the &ldquo;Star Wars Kid&rdquo;) and the log files it generated. We&rsquo;ll cover basic batch concepts as we build a robust, scalable batch application using Spring Batch to answer the question of who was watching this video when it went viral. No experience in Spring Batch is required for this talk.</p>
