				<p>The world of information security is changing in dramatic ways. In order to keep up with the demands of users and drive innovation, we have to start taking new approaches to securing our web applications. This means enabling increased security while decreasing friction for known good users. In order to make this happen it requires dynamic security controls. It means deriving intent through behavior. This approach not only makes for a more enjoyable experience for good users, it helps spot attacks in progress and trend developing threats such as botnets and DDoS attacks.</p><p>Join Aaron Bedra as he walks you through asking the questions you should be asking of your users activity, and how to help prevent abuse, fraud, and otherwise unwanted activity on your web applications while decreasing friction for good users. You will learn how to ask the right questions without interfering with a great user experience.</p>
