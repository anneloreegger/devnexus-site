				<p>Vaadin is a popular web framework that makes it possible to write rich user interfaces in server-side Java. Writing an application that lazily loads large amounts of data from the server, includes drag-and-drop, keyboard navigation and compelling visualizations would not require writing any HTML, JavaScript or resigning a REST API. While the server centric development model provides the best productivity, Vaadin also supports client-side development though the GWT based Java to JavaScript compiler as well as JavaScript. The default looks of the application can be customized with CSS and SASS.</p><p>The presentation gives an overview to Vaadin and explain how it works. We&rsquo;ll also discuss on what are the latest new features of Vaadin and how the roadmap looks. The session should give you everything you need to get started building your own apps with the free Apache-licensed Vaadin.</p>
