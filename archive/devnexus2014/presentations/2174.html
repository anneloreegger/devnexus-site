				<p>Lambda expressions are coming in Java 8 and dramatically change the programming model. They allow new functional programming patterns that were not possible before, increasing the expressiveness and power of the Java language.</p><p>In this university session, you will learn how to take advantage of the new lambda-enabled Java 8 APIs by building out a retro video game in JavaFX.</p><p>Some of the Java 8 features you will learn about include enhanced collections, functional interfaces, simplified event handlers, and the new stream API. Start using these in your application today leveraging the latest OpenJDK builds so you can prepare for the future Java 8 release.</p>
