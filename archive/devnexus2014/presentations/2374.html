				<p>In this session, we give an introduction to Platform as a Service (aka awesome-sauce for developers) with OpenShift as an example. You will get a chance to see why PaaS is one of the most important trends to affect the application development process. After a few slides on PaaS, we will spend the rest of the time working with code! First we will bring up Tomcat 7 and MySQL with one command. Then you to get your own JEE6 with JBoss EAP code up and running. We will show you how easy it is to bring in dependencies and deploy your code. We will also demonstrate how to connect your code to a MongoDB back-end data store. We will also have you merge in some of the <a href="https://github.com/openshift">Github quickstarts</a> we have assembled - including <a href="https://github.com/thesteve0/openshift-mongo-spatial-jee6">JEE6 with Mongo Spatial</a>. There are two goals of this session:</p><p>1) To leave knowing why you should start using a PaaS for your development work<br/>2) Leave with first hand knowledge on how to run your Java code in the cloud for free!</p>
