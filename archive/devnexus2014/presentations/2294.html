				<p>The age of large monolithic software architectures needs to come to close. A 1M LOC Java EE application is an example of such a monolith. They do not age well; are difficult to change; difficult to understand; difficult to test; difficult to diagnose issues; and quickly become saddled with overwhelming technical debt. We have introduced practices such as re-factoring and automated tests to help us deal with this insanity. Is there a better way? Micro services based architectures look very promising. But what exactly are micro services? How do you get started? What are the benefits? What are the trade-offs? How do you design them? I will share with you my journey to the discovery of micro services. The goal of the talk is to help you understand if a micro services based architecture might be a good fit for the business problem you are trying to solve.</p>
