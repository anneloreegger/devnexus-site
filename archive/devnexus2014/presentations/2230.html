				<p>This talk is a fast paced comparison of different ways of developing HTML5 Web applications. The audience will see seven versions of the same Web application. We&rsquo;ll start with architecture and code review of a basic HTML/JavaScript version of a sample charity application. After that we&rsquo;ll switch to its jQuery version, then you&rsquo;ll see how to do it with Ext JS framework, then we&rsquo;ll cut this application into slices for modularization reasons. The second part of this presentation is about moving this application to mobile devices. You&rsquo;ll see this application implemented with Responsive Design principles, and then two more versions: one with jQuery Mobile and the other with Sencha Touch. If time permits, we&rsquo;ll try to review one more version written in a new programming language that Java developers should learn. </p>
