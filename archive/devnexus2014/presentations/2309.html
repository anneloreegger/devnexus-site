				<p>Cloud computing is driving a new wave of innovation in the area of big data. All types of organizations are continuously looking at ways to improve efficiency of their infrastructure and at the same time manage IT costs effectively. The cloud is paving the way by helping companies with this challenge and by bringing innovation to market. Developers now have access to big data tools in the cloud which can give them the scale they need to either test a new idea or run a large project more cost effectively - and more quickly.<br/>In this session, we will walk through a real world application where the open source HPCC Systems platform can be launched with three different cloud providers (AWS, HP Public Cloud, or Rackspace) to make Big Data Analytics easier for developers. The Big Data platform can be launched and configured with the click of a button through their Instant Cloud solution built with jclouds. Apache jclouds is an open source library that helps you get started in the cloud and utilizes your Java development skills. The jclouds API gives you the freedom to use portable abstractions or cloud-specific features.<br/>HPCC Systems provides a single platform that is easy to install, manage, and code. Designed by data scientists, HPCC Systems is a data intensive supercomputer that has evolved for more than a decade. It was built for enterprise customers who needed to process large volumes of data in a 24/7 environment.<br/>Attendees will be shown how to create their own high performance computing cluster and/or query cluster with several different cloud providers using the HPCC Systems platform. Attendees will also be introduced to several production applications of the platform that include near real-time data ingestion, data fabrication, and machine learning. Taking advantage of HPCC Systems in the cloud provides a powerful combination designed to make data-intensive computing and massively concurrent queries more manageable.</p>
