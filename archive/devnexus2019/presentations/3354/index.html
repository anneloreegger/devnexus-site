				<p>The traditional ‘box’ layout model was designed to layout documents, not apps. Many hours have been lost endlessly tinkering with the positioning of HTML elements, but the joy at achieving perfect alignment is short-lived. Everything looks great until the size of the browser window changes, and it looks like you threw things on a page from across the room. There’s a better way! 
In this talk I will teach you about the flexbox layout model and CSS grid. We will cover these concepts at a high level, discuss why they are a better approach, and I will show you how to use them effectively. Used in tandem, these widely supported techniques can make your pages responsive, more accessible, and easier to build.</p>
