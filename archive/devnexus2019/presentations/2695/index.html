				<p>Java is on a fast new release cycle with releases every 6 months. Many enterprises were waiting for Java 11 - the long term support release. Now that it is out is a great time to review the new features in Java 10 and 11 along with a preview of what will be in Java 12. This talk emphasizes the changes in the release model so your team can make sure their next upgrade is on the right track.</p>
