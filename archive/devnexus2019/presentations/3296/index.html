				<p>MicroProfile is well established as a microservices development platform. It blazed the trail for the Jakarta EE movement. In it’s short tenure, MicroProfile has introduced us to the Fault Tolerance, JWT Propagation, Metrics, Rest Client, Config, Health Check, OpenAPI, and OpenTracing programming models. But, what’s next for these two key Eclipse projects? Will MicroProfile stay independent and continue to demonstrate it’s fast-paced innovation? Or, will it be combined with Jakarta EE, which is also promising a faster development cycle than the previous Java EE platform? Come to this session to learn about our current direction and to provide feedback.</p>
