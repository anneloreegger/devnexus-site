				<p>The Amazon Echo is more than a home toy - you can have the real star trek experience in your home with hooks into home automation platforms, streaming music, news, help you cook, tell you jokes, etc. Now let’s use Micronaut to build Alexa Skills! I will go over how to make them in two ways, via Micronaut web app and via functions with AWS Lamba. You can use Groovy, Java or Kotlin for both of these approaches! I will bring one to demonstrate some fun things you can do with it. I’m sure if you don’t already have one you’ll be hacking away as soon as you get home.</p>
