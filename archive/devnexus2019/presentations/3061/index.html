				<p>Do you lose sleep at night because you’re worried about app secrets lying bare in cloud? Proper management of app secrets is critical. We’ve seen too many high profile companies suffer from security breaches over the years. Developers hide secrets and make them hard to find – this is a hide and seek game that has plenty of potentials to lose; it’s just a matter of time.  In this session we will take a fresh look at managing secrets by default; using app identities and role based access, connecting to cloud services without connection strings and securing remaining secrets in vaults.</p>
