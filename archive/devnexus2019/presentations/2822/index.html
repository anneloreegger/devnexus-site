				<p>Have you ever wonder why you need to override equals and hashcode at the same time? Or why system.currenttimemillis() might not be good enough to measure things? Or why choose LinkedList vs ArrayList? Or why you get weird “state” and behavior on a Spring Bean? Or why the internet says not to use Double for currency? We explore these and more “cases” that make you go “…huh…” in Java. After this talk, you can then be demistifyed on a lot of things, and make sure you are making the “Right” decision, and not just a copy/paste from StackOverflow</p>
