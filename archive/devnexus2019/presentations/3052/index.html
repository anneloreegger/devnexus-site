				<p>Every business going through organizational transformation to gain a competitive advantage faces the same challenge: how do we balance agility and stability? To solve for the agility part of this equation, many development and operations teams turn to continuous integration (CI) and continuous development/deployment (CD), however these practices often put stability at risk. Enter Continuous Reliability.</p>

<p>Continuous Reliability (CR) is a new framework that brings together automated code quality gates and contextual feedback loops within a CI/CD workflow to help organizations overcome the agility/stability paradox. CR can mean the difference between hoping your code might work in production, and actually knowing it will.</p>

<p>In this session, Eric Mizell, VP of Solution Engineering at OverOps, will define CR for attendees and demonstrate how they can implement this practice within the context of their organization’s own transformation.</p>

<p>The session will follow the below outline:
–Introduce and define the concept of CR</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Quality Gates
Feedback Loops
–How are organizations approaching this problem today and the challenges they encounter
–The benefits of CR
–CR in Practice: How CR is implemented at Comcast
–Key tools and best practices
–Q&amp;A</p>
</blockquote>
