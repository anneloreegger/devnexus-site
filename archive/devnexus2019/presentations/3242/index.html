				<p>GraalVM is an integrated, polyglot, high-performance execution environment for dynamic, static, and native languages. One of the abilities of GraalVM is to compile Java programs ahead of time into native images that offer performance comparable to running on the JVM but have instant startup times and much lower runtime overhead. Generating native images is proven to work on real-world applications. In this session, you will learn how native images work and what is required to generate them and will look at several examples of compiling programs ahead of time and packaging them into minimal (&lt;10 MB) containers. You’ll also see how to configure native image generation, work around the limitations, and configuring your application to use native images.</p>
