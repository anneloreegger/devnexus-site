				<p>In Java 8 functional style programming was introduced in Java. Although many are still working Java 8, new releases 9,10 and 11 extended this with some nice new features. For many people it is hard to grasp the idea of functional style programming after so many years of purely working in the imperative OOP style. The opportunities Java gives us out of the box are massive, but with great power comes great responsibility.</p>
