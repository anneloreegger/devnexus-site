			<div class="biography-body">
				<p>Now that Kubernetes has become the defacto standard for Linux container orchestration and the new monolith and microservices application platform, the next battle is for serverless architecture where Functions rule and there are numerous Open Source players competing for relevance in this space.   Your future cloud native applications will consist of both microservces and functions, often wrapped as Linux containers, but in many cases where you the developer ignore the operational aspects of managing that infrastructure.</p>

<p>In this session, we will be diving into Knative as serverless “base primitives” for Kubernetes.</p>
