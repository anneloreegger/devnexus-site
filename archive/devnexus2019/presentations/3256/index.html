				<p>Ah a typical day at work.  Come in, get your coffee, check email…  What does that typical day in the life of a modern batch developer look like?  We aren’t talking about someone running COBOL or batch jobs on bare metal somewhere.  What does the day for a cloud native batch developer look like?  How are they monitoring their jobs?  How are they deploying them?  How are they scheduling them?  In this talk, we will walk through the typical life cycle of a batch job using modern tools including Spring Batch, Spring Cloud Task, Spring Cloud Data Flow, Circle CI for CI/CD, and a modern platform to run our batch jobs on.</p>
