				<p>JUnit 5 has been out for a year, so what is the big fuss and why should I take the time to update my existing automated tests to use JUnit 5? In this presentation we will look at many of the new features that have been added in JUnit 5 and not only how they make automated testing easier, but allow developers and organizations to encourage and enforce good development practices through the tests we write. If you have been wondering why you should make the switch from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5 you will definitely want to check out this presentation.</p>
