      Oracle offers a steeply discounted rate on certification exams like the OCA and OCP if you take them during the beta period. In this workshop, I’ll be teaching exam topics (including those from Java 9/10/11) and helping attendees get hands on practice with certification type questions and coding. While it isn’t possible to be ready for the test in just a day, we’ll have covered some of the hardest parts and you’ll have a plan to be ready. Even if you don’t intend to take the test, this is an opportunity to get familiar with some of the trickier aspects of some of the new Java features.

    <div class="presentation-body">
      Java is on a fast new release cycle with releases every 6 months. Many enterprises were waiting for Java 11 - the long term support release. Now that it is out is a great time to review the new features in Java 10 and 11 along with a preview of what will be in Java 12. This talk emphasizes the changes in the release model so your team can make sure their next upgrade is on the right track.
