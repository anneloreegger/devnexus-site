    <div class="presentation-body">
      Have you ever wonder why you need to override equals and hashcode at the same time? Or why system.currenttimemillis() might not be good enough to measure things? Or why choose LinkedList vs ArrayList? Or why you get weird "state" and behavior on a Spring Bean? Or why the internet says not to use Double for currency? We explore these and more "cases" that make you go "...huh..." in Java. After this talk, you can then be demistifyed on a lot of things, and make sure you are making the "Right" decision, and not just a copy/paste from StackOverflow

This talk will give a behind the scenes look at all that goes into open source projects. Learn the differences between projects run by individuals, foundations and companies. Find out ways to contribute even if you're not a coder. Finally learn about some of the common processes and responsibilities associated with contributing to an open source project. Over the past 20 years open source has had a huge impact on the future of software development. It's been said the best way to predict the future is create it. Come find out how to be a part of the future today.
