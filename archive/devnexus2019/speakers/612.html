      Ah, JavaScript! Like it or not, it's a "tragically important" language that is "eating the world." Hate it? Love it? Avoid it? Embrace it?

This talk will be a parade of face-palm JavaScript fails, stupid JavaScript tricks, and bad jokes sure to get an eye-roll from everyone! 

Along the way, we may even learn a few mistakes to avoid and tips to make our own JavaScript less terrible!
