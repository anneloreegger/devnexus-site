      There are many ways to improve productivity and generate positive outcomes with software development. One aspect that is frequently overlooked is the idea of friction. This talk looks at the aspects of development that makes things painful or difficult to get work done and how to make it better. Have you ever thought...."It's too tough to get things done?". We'll look at a number of different elements that can make development teams less productive, and discuss why they occur and how to remediate them. This will include topics such as language and framework choice, immutable infrastructure, and both GitOps and DevOps techniques. For each of the areas we will provide some common symptoms and dive deep into specific processes or technical solutions to resolve the issue.
