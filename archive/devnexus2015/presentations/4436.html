				<p>This 2015 presentation covers the Guava library developed by Google (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/)">http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/)</a>.<br/>Guava provides collection extensions to the Java Collection API and, along with this, a cornucopia of time-saving<br/> utilities that bring Java as close as possible to some of the more functional<br/> and/or dynamic language competitors like Scala, Ruby, and Clojure. Why a brand spanking new 2015 version of this presentation? Well, there more new stuff to learn and use!</p><p>This presentation covers briefly on functions, predicates and how they interact with Java 8. It covers how to use new collection constructs that make life easier, including MultiMap, BiMaps, and MultiSets, immutable collections, handling Futures with callbacks and shutdowns, caches, and then we will dwell on tons of the newer features that came with Releases 16, 17, and 18.</p>
