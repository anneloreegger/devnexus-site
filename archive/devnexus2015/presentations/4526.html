					Woo</div>
				<div class="presentation-body">
					<p>Justin Woo is a Developer Evangelist at PayPal and has been programming ever since he got his first IBM XT running DOS. He loves writing mobile applications (especially hybrid-HTML5 applications) and wishes everything could be done in LISP. In his spare time he enjoys tinkering around with cool hardware. Heâ€™s built a game for Autistic Children, a Robot that can be controlled remotely and even a Kinect game involving tapeworms. He graduated from Purdue University with a degree in Computer Engineering and was previously a Program Manager at Microsoft. He lives with his wife and two wonderful dogs - one of which refuses to admit that he is blind and the other that likes to pretend she&rsquo;s a rabbit. In his spare time he loves playing squash and board games (his favorite being Settlers of Catan). He also grew up in Singapore and so please don&rsquo;t mind his Singlish.</p>
