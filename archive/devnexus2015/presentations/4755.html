				<p>You have been using Git for a while now. You understand the DAG and how commands like merge and rebase work. But there is a lot more to Git such as the stash, reflog, and interactive rebases. How can one use these to make their more effective use of Git?</p><p>In this session we will look at some of the advanced facilities that Git offers. We will see how we can use the stash to improve our workflow with Git, how we use rebsae to rewrite and even split commits. After this session you will be well on your way to Git mastery.</p>
