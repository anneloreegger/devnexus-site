				<p>Design patterns are common place in OO programming. With the introduction of lambda expressions in languages like Java, one has to wonder about their influence on design patterns. In this presentation we will take up some of the common design patterns and rework them using lambda expressions. We will also explore some other patterns that are not so common, but are quite useful ways to apply lambdas.</p>
