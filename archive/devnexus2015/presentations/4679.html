				<p>In a micro services world the details of the infrastructure underlying our small services becomes less important. Most pieces will not require any special optimizations and can be run on standardised infrastructure. Do we need to control this standardised infrastructure or should we look into defining the work a part should accomplish through code and leave the rest to a service provider to figure out?</p><p>Is Docker the future of defining those work centers? Or is even Docker too low level and are services like AWS Lambda the future that completely abstract the underlying infrastructure away and provide a purely functional and event driven way to compose infrastructure.</p><p>Topics to Discuss</p><p>How much should we standardise for MicroServices<br/>Which level should be the lowest level we control<br/>Is Event driven asynchronous infrastructure the future<br/>Would this lock us too much into a specific provider<br/>How much does lock-in matter with small services built on open source frameworks</p>
