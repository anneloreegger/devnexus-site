				<p>This is a hands-on workshop/extended lab to introduce the Java EE 7 platform.</p><p>The main theme of Java EE 7 is boosting productivity and embracing HTML 5. The changes include APIs like JAX-RS 2, JMS 2, Java Batch, Java EE Concurrency, WebSocket, JSON-P and JSF 2.2. The workshop will introduce these changes in a step-by-step fashion using a realistic end-to-end application deployed on GlassFish 4 using NetBeans.</p><p>Although the primary focus will be on the new APIs and features, we will take a holistic approach to the workshop and also cover the features introduced in Java EE 5 and Java EE 6 such as the ones in EJB 3, CDI, JPA, Bean Validation and JSF focused on annotations, intelligent defaults, type-safe, powerful, fluent APIs.</p><p>At the end of the workshop, you will have a broad introduction to Java EE 7 and will be ready to write your own applications having already written quite a bit of code in the workshop.</p>
