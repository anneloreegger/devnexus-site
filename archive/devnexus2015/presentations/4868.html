				<p>Front-end web development is at an extremely exciting juncture. A plethora of new tools have emerged over the last years to deal with the ever growing complexity of front-end development in a multi device world.Sass is one piece of the front-end system; a powerful tool that has addressed the short comings of CSS by bringing programming concepts to front-end developers and designers. </p><p>In this session we&rsquo;ll cover the core Sass feature set from a practical, daily use perspective. The goal is to introduce you to Sass concepts so that you leave feeling more comfortable with Sass and walk away with new Sassy insights to take back to your team or solo-practice as well as techniques for improving your front-end development process. </p><h3>Topics</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sass data types: variables, maps, and lists</li>
  <li>Mixins, extends, and functions</li>
  <li>Control directives</li>
  <li>File organization: partials, nesting, @import</li>
  <li>Sass ecosystem: extensions and the community</li>
  <li>Sass and the Node.js/IO.js ecosystem, including Ruby Sass and Libsass</li>
</ul><p><strong>N.B.</strong></p><p>Learning is best learned by doing. Exercises will be provided for you to follow along,. You don&rsquo;t need to have Sass running on your machine to participate. </p>
