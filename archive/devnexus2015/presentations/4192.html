				<p>ElasticSearch is an open source search and analytics engine that is easy to configure and deploy. This talk will explore some of the differentiating and compelling features that Elasticsearch offers, as it becomes the defacto full-text provider for the enterprise. Deploying Elasticsearch is a trivial endeavor, but knowing how to configure your cluster initially for optimal performance, is an art. In this presentation, I will share much of what I&rsquo;ve learned in deploying and scaling-out massive Elasticsearch clusters that were designed from the ground up, optimized for performance with a specific use in mind. Some of the topics covered will focus on optimizing clusters, organizing and retrieving data, disaster recovery, and avoiding failure and performance degradation in a running cluster. Common and not-so-common deployment scenarios will also be investigated, such as: Log aggregation, Full-Text search, and its use in a CQRS architecture.</p>
