				<p>As our industry matures there is an increasing demand for high-throughput, low-latency systems heavily utilizing event-driven programming and asynchronous processing. This trend is rapidly converging on the somewhat well established but so-far not well understood term &ldquo;Reactive&rdquo;.</p><p>This session explores how Java EE as a whole aligns with this movement via features and APIs like JMS, MDB, EJB @Asynchronous, JAX-RS/Servlet async, CDI events, Java EE concurrency utilities and so on. We will also see how these robust facilities can be made digestible even in the most complex cases for mere mortal developers through Java SE 8 Lambdas and Completable Futures.</p>
