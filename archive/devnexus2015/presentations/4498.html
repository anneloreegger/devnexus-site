			<div class="biography-body">
				<p>For technical professionals, there are distinct differences between a career in Consulting versus a career in Industry. This session will describe both, the differences between the two, the advantages of each for a technically-oriented career, and how to determine which is better for you. The discussion will be neutral and intended to ensure the participants know their option and the longer term career impacts of their decisions. The presentation will also include information on what recruiters look for in resumes across both areas and how to best position yourself for either option.</p><p>The goal of the talk will be ensure the attendees know about great options available to them, how to assess these options in terms of their own personal characteristics and goals, and make intentional career decisions that set them up for long term success.</p>
