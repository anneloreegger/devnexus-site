				<p>You know that it&rsquo;s a wild and dangerous world out there on the Internet. You don&rsquo;t need to be convinced that your application needs to be secured against intruders, hackers, bots, and worms. You&rsquo;ve vaguely heard of XSS, CSRF, Authc, Authz, and the rest of the AppSec alphabet soup, but you&rsquo;re not sure how to structure your application, what controls you need, or how to make sure you&rsquo;re making the right investments of time and money to efficiently minimize risks.</p><p>This session will present some patterns and anti-patterns in web application architecture and process. We&rsquo;ll talk about how to identify the parts of your application that require the most attention and which parts of your SDLC need the most security TLC.</p><p>Examples will be mostly in Java and JavaScript, but the ideas will be largely language-agnostic, so attendees will not need to be experts in either. This will be a technical talk, but appropriate to both programmers in the trenches and the managers who love them.</p>
