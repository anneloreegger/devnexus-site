				<p>For this session we will explore the power of Spring XD in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT). We will look at a solution developed with Spring XD to stream real time analytics from a moving car using open standards. Ingestion of the real time data (location, speed, engine diagnostics, etc), analyzing it to provide highly accurate MPG and vehicle range prediction, as well as providing real time dashboards will all be covered. Coming out of this session, you’ll understand how Spring XD can serve as “Legos®” for the IoT.</p>
