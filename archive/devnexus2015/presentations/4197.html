				<p>Once upon a time, we used one computer at a time. Today is different. We find ourselves in a world where we use many devices simultaneously. As users, we expect all of our data to be available, and up to date on every device. As developers we know this means that we have to brave the complexity of synchronization and concurrency across many platforms.</p><p>Modern cloud development platforms provide a solution to this challenge. In this session, Jenny Tong, a Developer Advocate at Firebase, shows you how to use some of these technologies to make your real time, multi-platform development easier.</p>
