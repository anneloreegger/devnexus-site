				<p>Are you interested in learning how to take some existing code and apply the functional paradigm to it? Do you want to better understand how to recognize patterns of reuse and where Functional Programming can be implemented? We&rsquo;re going to take a small code block and refactor it into a Functional Paradigm. By the end of this, you should have a better understanding of what Functional Programming is and how it can benefit you and your teams as well as being able to recognize patterns of Functional Programming so that you can go and implement these concepts in your own code bases.</p>
