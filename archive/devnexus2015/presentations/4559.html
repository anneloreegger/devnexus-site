				<p>Monolithic applications may be the norm on-premise but in the cloud they spell trouble. The cloud is all about flexibility, your app needs to handle all types of unpredictable conditions while still functioning like nothing is wrong. To be flexible in the cloud you need to think small, really small, one app per component small. These small highly specialized apps are called microservices, and when combined, provide the ultimate cloud based application that scales, is fault tolerant, and is easy to maintain and deploy. In this session you will learn all about microservices and why this architectural pattern is the way to go when building cloud applications.</p>

					<p>Exploring new languages, frameworks, and technologies, and then sharing what he’s learned, has always come naturally to Ryan. Even when it wasn&rsquo;t his day job, Ryan has always been driven by his passion, spending his time and energy educating his friends, colleagues, or anyone else that would listen. Now, as a Developer Advocate at IBM, he has found a role that’s a perfect fit for him. Currently, Ryan is focusing on application development in the cloud using various technologies, like Node.js and Docker, and applying those technologies to application solutions around mobile, IoT, and more. When he’s not coding, Ryan likes spending time with his daughter, ice fishing, and watching the Red Sox.</p>
