				<p>We all take version control for granted. And it is, when it comes to code. On the database side, however schema evolution is often performed ad-hoc: a quick statement here, a little script there. The result: confusion and uncertainty. Has this update already been applied on this instance? Should we apply this other script first? Is our application going to run against this database?</p><p>No more! This is where database migration tools come to the rescue! We&rsquo;ll look at a popular open-source choice called Flyway. By the end of the session, you&rsquo;ll have a solid understanding of what it does, how it works and how to effectively integrate it into your project. We&rsquo;ll look at concepts and solutions. We&rsquo;ll tackle the hard problems and show you how this fits in a Continuous Delivery and Zero Downtime workflow. This will transform how you deal with your database, and you&rsquo;ll never look back.</p>
