				<p>Programming with Lambda Expressions in Java<br/>Now that Java is supporting lambda expressions, it&rsquo;s time to hone our skills to make use of them. Lambda expressions can help create concise code, however, it takes more than learning the syntax to put them to good use. In this presentation we will learn the idiomatic use of lambda expressions, explore the ways in which we can use them to solve common tasks, and look into libraries and APIs that make use of them in Java.</p>
