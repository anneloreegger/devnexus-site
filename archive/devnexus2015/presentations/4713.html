				<p>Making a call to a web URL and then processing a JSON response within an Android app is essential to the developers toolbook. It can be daunting, frustrating, boring and confusing and there are NO good tutorials on the internet. This presentation will walk beginners through the creation, processing and parsing of a JSON call, with an hilarious analogy for each line of code. Audience participation will be requested for a paper-bag-puppet show to further nail down the concepts. No one who attends this session will ever get lost in the quagmire of JSON again. </p><p>Participants will walk away with a Github link to the code we&rsquo;ve created and a copy of the presentation slides. One former participant reviewed the session as “The best Tuesday ever.” </p>
