				<p>In this talk you will learn about a modern way of designing applications that’s very different from the traditional approach of building monolithic applications that persist mutable domain objects in a relational database.We will talk about the microservice architecture, it’s benefits and drawbacks and how Spring Boot can help. You will learn about implementing business logic using functional, immutable domain models written in Scala. We will describe event sourcing and how it’s an extremely useful persistence mechanism for persisting functional domain objects in a microservices architecture.</p>
