				<p>Apache Camel is more than just an integration framework. It is the heart of many modern micro-services infrastructures. In this workshop I am going to walk you through a pre build demo about a investment bank scenario where we are going to manage investment funds. We are trying to modernize our infrastructure by utilizing an event-driven architecture to process new funds when they get created. However, on of our business partners can&rsquo;t/won&rsquo;t update their communication strategies, so we&rsquo;re stuck with trying to modernize within some constraints. All this is going to happen with the help of JBoss Fuse utilizing different contained components like Apache Camel, A-MQ and others to build and change an application with the JBoss Developer Studio and deploy the example on OpenShift.</p>
