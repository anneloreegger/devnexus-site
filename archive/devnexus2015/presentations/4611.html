				<p>Git is a powerful version control system. Depending on how well one understands Git, it’s a tool that either instills fear and panic in the hearts of developers, or it&rsquo;s a powerful ally that can be relied upon in times of need. Have you ever wondered how rebasing works, or why you would choose to rebase instead of merge? What is a fast forward merge anyway? In this talk, not only will we discover why ‘The Brothers Grimm’ never published ‘Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Ogre’, but we’ll also cover Git basics and take a deeper dive that will elevate your Git foo.</p>

					<p>I am backend developer at Big Nerd Ranch in Atlanta, GA (USA), but the path here was long and windy. Prior to entering the world of programming and web development I earned a BA in Geography BA in Geography from the University of Georgia (USA) and a MS in Sustainable Resource Management from Technische Universität München (Freising, Germany) which led me to working with GIS (Geographical Information Systems) in field of Sustainability and Marine Science. And, it was here that I was first exposed to programming. Shortly after, I found Ruby, and have beed developing in Ruby for the last 3 years.</p><p>Apart from programming, I enjoy soccer, backpacking, dancing, reading and traveling. As a boy, I yearned to see the world beyond my farm in south Georgia (USA). Ever one to achieve my goals, I&rsquo;ve now been to 26 countries and counting. I&rsquo;m also passionate about volunteering and social justice. I&rsquo;ve organized charity hikes and bike rides, renovated houses for purchase by low-income families, and raised money for a nonprofit by hiking all 2,176 miles of the Appalachian Trail in six months.</p>
