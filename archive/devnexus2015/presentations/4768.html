				<p>Remember the epic Java Puzzlers? Here’s the Groovy version, and we have some neat ones! Even though we are totally a Grails shop here at JFrog, some of these had us scratching our heads for days trying to figure them out.<br/>And there is more! Contributions from the truly Groovy senseis, including @glaforge, @aalmiray, @tim_yates, @kenkousen make this talk an unforgettable journey to Groovy&rsquo;s O_o.<br/>In this talk you’ll have the expected dose of fun and enlightenment hearing about our mistakes and failures, great and small, in hardcore Groovy/Grails development.</p>
