				<p>Surviving as a zombie is tough&hellip; with the constant risks of sunlight, fire, and pesky mobs, doing your job of infecting the local villagers can be deadly. Fortunately, with the new JavaFX ZombieTime app, powered by the JSR 310 Date and Time API, you can rest easy. With built-in time zone and DST support you no longer have to worry about roaming around under the scorching hot sun. Accurately calculate out how long you have to infect the villagers before you decompose using Durations. And coordinate global attacks on the humans by syncing with your undead brethren on Instants. With the power of Java 8, eradicating the human race with a highly infectious virus has never been easier!</p><p>This presentation is designed to teach Java Date and Time APIs to the undead, but the living are welcome to be our &ldquo;guests&rdquo;. You may also learn some JavaFX in the process &ndash; that is entirely my fault. Any correlation between the characters and events in this presentation and the impending extinction of mankind is purely coincidental.</p>
