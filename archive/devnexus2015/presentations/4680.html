				<p>You have started to hear about microservices and you want to learn more about what happens when the rubber meets the road. We will start with an introduction to the basic ideas behind microservices. From there I will go over some pros and cons. To anchor the talk in reality, I will cover the process I went through in constructing <a href="http://wwww.flatfluffy.com/">http://wwww.flatfluffy.com</a>, a multi-device application for gamified recording of roadkill. This will include the code and tools I used to run the whole application. In particular I will show how this type of architecture was used to produce the mapping experience in FlatFluffy. My talk style is very informal and interactive so there will be a back and forth to discuss some of your implementation questions. Come in curious, leave with some solid ideas in how to get started on your first microservice architected application.</p>
