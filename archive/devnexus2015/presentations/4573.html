				<p>UX Designers like to think that the top navigation of a website is really important. It&rsquo;s a critical component to the User Experience&hellip;right?</p><p>UXers internalize this belief, because they were raised on it. Before the web became interactive, it was information architecture that put UX designers on the map (or the job boards, rather). All those &ldquo;pages&rdquo; of static content had to be bucketed, filed, and organized. The navigation, with it’s top of the page prominence, was their claim to fame! But in our practice today, what is the very first thing that we hide when screen size gets tight?</p><p>The navigation.</p><p>In addition, we are starting to see that users actually downright ignore the nav, even when it’s visible in all of its desktop,docked glory. Users go straight for the big shiny objects - the content on the page.</p><p>So, if we hamburgered our navigation on mobile, and people ignore it on desktop, how do we get people to flow through our site? Well, the content must become the navigation. This is where Object Oriented UX comes in. OOUX helps create an efficient, elegant modular system. UXers, designers, and developers reduce rework, and the end user will have a more consistent experience.</p><p>This talk will introduce OOUX, walk through examples, and show you how to incorporate it into your process.</p>

					<p>After a leading the cross-device design of CNN&rsquo;s 2012 election results, Sophia began thinking, writing, and speaking about what responsive design can teach us about elegant simplicity. For the past 2 years, Sophia has be applying these principles all her projects: responsive or not. In this highly applicable talk, Sophia will teach a crash course on Object Oriented UX, or OOUX, the center piece of her simplicity strategy. </p>
