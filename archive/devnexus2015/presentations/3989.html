				<p>Maybe you have heard the name &ldquo;functional programming&rdquo; and you&rsquo;re interested to learn <em>what</em> it is. Well there is no better way to learn a new paradigm than by actually seeing it implemented. In this workshop we&rsquo;ll take a working code example and transform it into the functional paradigm all in Java 7. We&rsquo;ll step through everything from higher-order functions, function purity and even to some levels of immutability. At the end, we&rsquo;ll show how we can make use of Java 8&rsquo;s lambdas by very simple changes to the code that we&rsquo;ve already refactored.<br/>At the end, you should be able to take the concepts that you learn from this workshop and start using them the next day at work!</p>
