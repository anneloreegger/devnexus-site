				<p>&ldquo;Wait, wait! Don&rsquo;t pwn Me!&rdquo; is a live, developer and security news game show that pits three developer luminaries against each other in a game of wits. Past participants have included Joshua Corman, Chris Eng, Space Rogue and Matt Tesauro. Host Mark Miller, selects topics from the week&rsquo;s developer and security news, posing the news items as limericks, fill-in-the-blank, and audience participation questions. The panel competes against each other, and the audience, for speed and accuracy when answering the questions.</p><p>During the AppSec USA 2013 Conference, the RSA 2014 Conference and the 2014 AppSec USA, and the AppSec 2014 Europe Conference this was a rollicking, high spirited session, exposing the prevalence of developer and security issues highlighted in the main stream news. It demonstrates how hard it is to keep up to date, even for the experts. Audience members should come prepared as we test their knowledge against the panel, trying to determine what is real news and what is fake. </p><p>This is a fun filled session where panelists and audience members compete for prizes. It is sure to put you in a good mood for the rest of the conference.</p>
