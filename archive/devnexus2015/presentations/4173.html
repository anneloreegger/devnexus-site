			<div class="biography-body">
				<p>As developers, we deal with management all the time but aren&rsquo;t normally interested in becoming managers ourselves. In fact, we take a perverse pride in being difficult to manage and being more interested in being right than doing what is politically expedient.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, this leads to difficulties when business crises arise, like reorganizations, layoffs, or simply new opportunities that we would like to pursue. It&rsquo;s hard to get what you want when we&rsquo;re viewed as part of the problem rather than the solution.</p><p>This talk is about understanding the world of your manager and how you can take simple steps to build a relationship that you can rely on when you need it.</p>
