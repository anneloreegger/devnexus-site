				<p>In only the last few years, Responsive Design patterns and paradigms have brought forth spectacular, sweeping changes in UI web production. The demands for device-compliance as well as the always-growing mobile market have made Responsive Design a necessity for many websites and web applications. While taking the Responsive approach may offer incredible opportunities, it also carries a gamut of challenges.</p><p>This session will cover best practices for the planning, production, and management of Responsive websites. It will also serve as an introduction to Responsive website creation using the Bootstrap 3 framework. We will explore the mechanics of the Bootstrap grid and explore how it may be used to create robust, flexible Responsive layouts. Topics central to the presentation include mobile-first production, content focus, site maintainability and performance.</p>
