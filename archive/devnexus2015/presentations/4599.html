				<p>Looking past the former hype topics like enterprise application integration and ESBs and SOA and alike: Fact is, that the need for reliable integration solutions which are manageable and scalable is growing. More devices and data-sources combined with new and upcoming use-cases and exciting wearables in a cloudified and heterogeneous infrastructure require more bits and pieces than just a central ESB with some rules and point to point connections. How would that look like? And how to keep this kind of solutions manageable?</p>
