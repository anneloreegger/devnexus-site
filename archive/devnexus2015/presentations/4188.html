				<p>JMS is the Java standard for accessing enterprise messaging systems. This session introduces JMS 2.0 (JSR 343), the first update in more than a decade and easily the longest-awaited component of the forthcoming Java EE 7 standard. The biggest new feature of JMS 2.0 is a new API that makes JMS much easier to use, especially in a Java EE application. JMS 2.0 also provides API features to support greater scalability as well as additional messaging features and a long list of minor enhancements and clarifications. With JMS 2.0 final with Java EE 7, now is an ideal time to find out more about it. </p><p>In this session, we will also discuss what might be next for the JMS specification.</p>
