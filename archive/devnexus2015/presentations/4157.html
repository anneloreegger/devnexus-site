				<p>Containers are enabling developers to package their applications (and underlying dependencies) in new ways that are portable and work consistently everywhere—on your machine, in production, in your data center, and in the cloud. And Docker has become the de facto standard for those portable containers in the cloud, whether you’re working with Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, or Microsoft Azure.</p><p>Docker is the developer-friendly Linux container technology that enables creation of your stack: OS, JVM, app server, app, and all your custom configuration. So with all it offers, how comfortable are you and your team taking Docker from development to production? Are you hearing developers say, “But it works on my machine!” when code breaks in production? And if you are, how many hours are then spent standing up an accurate test environment to research and fix the bug that caused the problem?</p><p>This lab offers developers an intro-level, hands-on session with Docker, from installation (including boot2docker on Windows/Mac), to exploring Docker Hub, to crafting their own images, to adding Java apps and running custom containers. </p><p>This is a BYOL (bring your own laptop) session, so bring your Windows, OSX, or Linux laptop and be ready to dig into a tool that promises to be at the forefront of our industry for some time to come. Prerequisites for the session will be published at burrsutter.com and announced via Twitter @burrsutter prior to the session. </p>
