				<p>Developers are facing a new era of development with HTML5 for both mobile and desktop environments. It was once laughable to put mobile focused development ahead of the desktop, but those days are over. Whether youâ€™re focused only on mobile, desktop, or both, there are a few critical questions which must be answered:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Which platforms and browsers should I support?</li>
  <li>Which HTML5 related specifications are available on those platforms?</li>
  <li>How do I integrate existing enterprise services?</li>
  <li>How do I test my app?</li>
</ul><p>Wesley will attempt to answer these questions with the latest market data and live demos. Attendees will learn what it takes to build a scalable, enterprise, HTML5 based application for both desktop and mobile environments.</p><p><strong>The slides are not available.</strong></p>
