				<p>This session will provide an introductory overview of Android&rsquo;s architecture and the layout of an Android project. When building Android apps, you may want to take advantage of a third party library, like Spring Android. You can do this through the use of various Maven plugins and tools for enabling dependency management in your Android project. We will walk through how to set up and configure an Android project using Maven. Many applications consume data from various web services, and we will discuss how the Spring Android project can help. </p><p>Spring Android provides an abstraction for consuming RESTful services and marshaling the requests and responses to JSON or XML. Lastly, Spring Android supports the use of Spring Social on Android, and we will discuss how Spring Social can help you connect your apps to OAuth protected services like Facebook and Twitter.</p>
