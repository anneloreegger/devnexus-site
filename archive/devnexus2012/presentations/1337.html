				<p>This talk will describe the Cloud Foundry Open PaaS (Platform as a Service), with its open source, multi-framework, multi-service, multi-cloud model, and will explain in depth how to use Cloud Foundry services effectively from Java/Spring applications. Cloud Foundry allows developers to provision apps in Java/Spring, Ruby/Rails, Ruby/Sinatra, Javascript/Node, and leverage services like MySQL, MongoDB, Reddis, Postgres and RabbitMQ. It can be used as a public PaaS on CloudFoundry.com and other service providers (ActiveState, AppFog), to create your own private cloud, or on your laptop using the Micro Cloud Foundry VM. Attendees will be introduced to the tools available for Spring application developers using Cloud Foundry: STS (Spring Tool Suite) Cloud Foundry Plugin, the Cloud Foundry Maven plugin or the vmc command line. Attendees will be introduced to how Cloud Foundry exposes service information to applications, and the various options Spring app developers have to leverage these services: </p>
<ul>
  <li>using the auto-reconfiguration mechanism that allows using services without any modifications to the app</li>
  <li>using the &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; namespace to have an explicit control over consuming services</li>
  <li>combining the profile support in Spring 3.1 with the &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; namespace to create applications that allow explicit control over services, while allowing applications to run locally or in Cloud Foundry without any change.</li>
</ul><p>The talk will include demos of the Spring app development lifecycle with Cloud Foundry: local development with STS, local deployment to Micro Cloud Foundry for testing, deployment to <a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.com/">CloudFoundry.com</a>.</p>
