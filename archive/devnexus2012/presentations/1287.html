				<p>Dart is a new structured programming language designed for the Web. In this talk, we’ll look at the motivation for Dart, language syntax and features, the Dart Editor, using the Dart JS compiler, and the Dart development cycle with frog server and Dartium. We’ll also look at improvements to the DOM, several sample apps built with Dart, and see how easy it is to use Dart with HTML5+CSS to create rich client applications that scale.</p>
