				<p>Groovy has several ways to make web development easier. Groovlets are part of the language, are easy to use and deploy, and are the basis of larger frameworks like Gaelyk. Groovy also supports the new style of web development with micro-frameworks. One in particular is Ratpack, based on the Sinatra project in the Ruby world. Finally, there is Grails, the elegant combination of Groovy DSLs with Spring and Hibernate. This talk will demonstrate them all and discuss where each is useful and appropriate.</p>
