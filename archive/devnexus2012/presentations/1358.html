				<p>Titanium is an open-source development tool for producing cross-platform mobile applications by Appcelerator. Using Titanium, you develop your mobile application using Javascript coded against the Titanium API&rsquo;s. Titanium Developer, a management GUI for your mobile apps, invokes their compiler and builder to take your Javascript and build a native application for iOS and Android.</p><p>This session will walk you through the details of building great apps for the Android and iOS platforms. We&rsquo;ll talk about Titanium development, its ecosystem, and architecture. We&rsquo;ll spend time looking at lots of code - we&rsquo;ll build an app, in fact, while we discuss and explore the framework. We&rsquo;ll also spend some time discussing best practices, what to expect when developing against it, and the limits of this type of development.</p>
