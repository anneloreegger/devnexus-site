				<p>Google AppEngine lets you build and host scalable Web applications written in Python or Java on Googleâ€™s infrastructure. In this talk, we&rsquo;ll look at new features in the last year, including the high-replication datastore (HRD), Cloud SQL, the new query planner, and cross-group transactions. In addition, we&rsquo;ll look at a recipe for load testing and many tips to make your apps more responsive and minimize cost.</p><p>Guest speaker Mike Lawrence from <a href="http://www.theice.com/">theice.com</a> will also demo an app (<a href="http://wordpong.com/">http://wordpong.com</a>) created and hosted on Google App Engine and discuss his experience with the App Engine Datastore.</p>
