				<p>The cloud movement is no longer just buzz and hype. Organizations are increasingly planning cloud-based deployments. For greenfield development, the path is relatively clear, but what about existing apps? The monolithic multi-tier architecture so common for enterprise apps is not the best fit for the cloud. For one thing, the presentation layer is typically moving to the client side. With cloud-based messaging and NoSQL datastore options, the data access and integration layers might require renovation as well. Meanwhile the significant investment that a business would most like to salvage is in the service layer sandwiched in the middle. In this session, we&rsquo;ll explore this space while migrating a hypothetical application to run in the cloud. The starting point will be a fairly standard multi-tier Spring MVC application, and the end result will be a collection of services running in the cloud. We&rsquo;ll discuss REST, JSON, NoSQL, messaging, polyglot development, and modular architectures designed to run in a dynamic always-on environment.</p>
