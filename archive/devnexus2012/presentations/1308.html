				<p>I have talked to a lot of people about Ehcache over the years. What people find most valuable, and what stays with them, is the underlying caching theory - you can see the light bulb go on.</p><p>In this talk we will start with a performance problem and lead you through solving it with caching, discovering a long the way the problems of distributed caching and their solution. This will equip you with the tools to analyse a performance situation and to see whether a cache will help and what type of cache to apply.</p><p>Topics include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why caching works</li>
  <li>Standalone cache performance and effectiveness</li>
  <li>Tiered Cache Design</li>
  <li>N * Problem</li>
  <li>Cache Cluster topologies</li>
  <li>Cache Coherency Problem</li>
  <li>CAP and PACELC constraints</li>
  <li>Overcoming Java&rsquo;s limitations with BigMemory</li>
  <li>Useful Cache Patterns</li>
