				<p>In early 2001, &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; was coined as the umbrella term for Scrum, XP, ASD, Crystal, and a few other methodologies. In 2003, Mary and Tom Poppendieck published the book &ldquo;Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit&rdquo;, and the term Lean Software Development became known among a subset of the larger Agile community.</p><p>For years, one could assume that any development group trying to improve its approach to software was applying some form of Agile Software Development methodology. In the last couple of years, Lean Software Development has seen a surge in popularity. Some groups adopting Lean perceive it as an alternative to Agile processes like Scrum, and express a sense of elitism and superiority, having &ldquo;moved beyond Agile&rdquo;.</p><p>While Agile Software Development and Lean Software Development originate from different sources, they are actually closely related and share a great deal of overlap. In this talk attendees will discover where each came from, and just how much of Agile and Lean are shared in the space between.</p><p><strong>This presentation did not take place and consequently the presentation slides are not available</strong></p>
