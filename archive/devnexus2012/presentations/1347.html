				<p>This session will introduce you to the cross-platform game library we created in the process of porting Rovio&rsquo;s &ldquo;Angry Birds&rdquo; to the browser, which we&rsquo;ve called &ldquo;PlayN&rdquo;. You&rsquo;ll learn how to use this library to write games in Java that run on modern web browsers, as well as on Flash and as Android and iOS apps. We&rsquo;ll also discuss some of the challenges of building games that target the web, from arithmetic and rendering performance, to rendering and audio bugs, hiding network lag, and avoiding garbage collection pauses.</p>
