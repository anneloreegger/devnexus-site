				<p>For a minor release, Spring Integration 2.1 delivers some major features. Channel Adapters are now available for AMQP-based messaging via RabbitMQ. Message Store implementations are now available for a number of NoSQL data stores, including GemFire, MongoDB, and Redis. Other noteworthy additions include JSR-223 scripting support, stored procedure adapters, and a new Content Enricher component. Attend this session to learn about these new features, and don&rsquo;t worry if you know nothing about Spring Integration yet, we&rsquo;ll begin with a quick introduction.</p>
