				<p>Before the web, software developers implemented what we now refer to as desktop applications, using powerful graphics APIs that gave them the ability to program pretty much anything they could imagine. Then along came browsers with virtually no standard graphics support at all. Enter boring web applications, and dull work for developers.</p><p>But now, with HTML5 Canvas, developers have a powerful graphics API that lets them develop mind-blowing applications. Now you can implement desktop-like applications that run in a browser. In this session, you?ll see how.</p><p>This talk is a demo-fueled, fast-paced introduction to HTML5 Canvas. You?ll get an overview of the Canvas API, and see how you can use it to draw, manipulate images, and implement sprite-based animation. You will get a feel for what you can do with this powerful API, and you?ll get a basic understanding of how to harness that power.</p>
