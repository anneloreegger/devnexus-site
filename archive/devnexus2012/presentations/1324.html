				<p>One easy way to add Groovy to existing Java systems is through testing. Writing tests in Groovy is easier than Java, without worrying about deploying Groovy in production. Groovy provides several capabilities to simplify testing, from GroovyTestCase and its subclasses to built-in mocks and stubs to the popular Spock framework. This talk will review the available options and demonstrate how to use them on combined Groovy and Java applications.</p>
