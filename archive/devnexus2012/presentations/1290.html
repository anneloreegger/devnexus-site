				<p>RESTful web services have become the preferred approach to synchronously integrating heterogeneous systems. The architectural styleâ€™s success is due in large part to its simplicity. Furthermore, REST is based on a small set of widely accepted standards, such as HTTP and XML and requires far fewer development steps, toolkits and execution engines than conventional SOAP web services.</p><p>This session covers the core concepts of REST and then walks through how to design and implement RESTful web services using three leading RESTful web service framewokrs, RESTlet, Spring MVC and NetKernel.</p>
