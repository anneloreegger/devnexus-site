				<p>Many development shops have made the leap from RCS, Perforce, ClearCase, PVCS, CVS, BitKeeper or SourceSafe to the modern Subversion (SVN) version control system. But why not take the next massive stride in productivity and get on board with Git, a distributed version control system (DVCS). Jump ahead of the masses staying on Subversion, and increase your team&rsquo;s productivity, debugging effectiveness, flexibility in cutting releases, and repository redundancy at $0 cost. Understand how distributed version control systems are game-changers and pick up the lingo that will become standard in the next few years.</p><p>In this talk, we discuss the team changes that liberate you from the central server, but still conform to the corporate expectation that there&rsquo;s a central master repository. You&rsquo;ll get a cheat sheet for Git, and a trail-map from someone who&rsquo;s actually experienced the Subversion to Git transition.</p><p><strong>Per request, the presentation slides won&rsquo;t be made available</strong>.</p>

					<p>Tim is a full-stack generalist and passionate teacher who loves coding, presenting, and working with people. He believes the best developer is one who is well-informed of specifics and can also make deep connections between software development and the broader world. He has recently been exploring non-relational data stores, build systems, and how software architecture should resemble an ant colony.</p><p>His firm, the <a href="http://augusttechgroup.com/">August Technology Group</a>, helps clients with product development, technology consulting, and technology upgrade projects on the JVM. The August Group&rsquo;s technology preferences reflect the generalist sensibilities of its founder, and its development practices are always lightweight, self-improving, and humanizing by design.</p><p>Tim is a speaker internationally and on the <a href="http://nofluffjuststuff.com/">No Fluff Just Stuff</a> tour in the United States, and is co-president of the <a href="http://denveropensource.org/">Denver Open Source User Group</a>, author of the open-source <a href="http://github.com/tlberglund/groovy-liquibase">Groovy Liquibase DSL</a>, co-author of the <a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/functional-programming-clojure">DZone Clojure RefCard</a>, co-presenter of the best-selling <a href="http://bit.ly/ogitvid">O&rsquo;Reilly Git Master Class</a>, co-author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/144930463X">Building and Testing with Gradle</a>, and a member of the <a href="http://oreilly.com/pub/expert/timberglund">O&rsquo;Reilly Expert Network</a>.</p><p>He lives in Littleton, CO with the wife of his youth and their three children. </p>
