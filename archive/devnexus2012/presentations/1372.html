				<p>Android 4.0 is a new world for Android, and for many developers who did not track with the changes to Honeycomb, represents a new UI metaphor. In this session we will look at the new UI metaphor and the APIs to work with it, including the ActionBar and Fragments, which allow you to recompose your UI for multiple screen profiles. We will also review the new Android human interface guide to see how these should be used.</p><p>Additionally, we will look at other new APIs that can be used to enhance the functionality of your application, including interactive Notifications, Drag and Drop, NFC and WiFi Direct.</p>
