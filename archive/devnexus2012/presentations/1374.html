				<p>Join us for a technical how-to session on how to develop cloud ready iPhone and Android apps for the cloud. Let&rsquo;s skip having to learn three different languages and jumpstart the development process using what you already know. We&rsquo;ll utilize Appcelerator&rsquo;s Titanium IDE to create a native mobile application targeting multiple mobile platforms. Best of all we&rsquo;ll be running everything on on JBoss AS 7.1 with a MongoDB back-end. Nothing complicated, nothing convoluted. Just straight ahead mobile development goodness with Titanium, MongoDB, JBoss and OpenShift. What&rsquo;s OpenShift? It&rsquo;s Red Hat&rsquo;s free, auto-scaling platform-as-a-service for Java, Ruby, Perl, PHP and Python apps.
