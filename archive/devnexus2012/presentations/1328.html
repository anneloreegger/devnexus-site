				<p>The success of the Java language and platform depends on community support and participation. Java is developed through the Java Community Process, which is open to all members of the Java community. Recent changes to the process, introduced in JSR 348, make it even easier for developers to observe and to participate in the work of the JCP.</p><p>Even before these changes Java User Groups had begun to participate in the work of the JCP. Now that two JUGs (SouJava and the London Java Community) are represented on the JCP&rsquo;s Executive Committee we are beginning to explore ways in which the energy, enthusiasm, and expertise of the JUG community can be harnessed to further advance the Java platforms.</p><p>Most developers understand the value of participating in open-source projects. This session will explain the benefits of participating in the JCP. We will explain how the JCP is is organized and how Java standards are developed. We will discuss the current state of the Java platforms, explain how the JCP is helping to evolve them, provide practical advice on how you can participate through your local Java User Group, and explain why participation is good for your career. </p><p>Bring your questions, your suggestions, and your concerns. We want to hear from you - the foundation of the Java community - and to explore new ideas for community participation.</p>
