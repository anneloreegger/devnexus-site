				<p>Want to go deep on a popular NoSQL database? Cassandra is a scalable, highly available, column-oriented data store in use at Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Rackspace, and other web-scale operations. It offers a compelling combination of a rich data model, a robust deployment track record, and a sound architecture, making it a good choice of NoSQL databases to study first.</p><p>In this session, we&rsquo;ll talk about Cassandra&rsquo;s data model, look at its query idioms, talk about how to deploy it, and look at use cases in which it is an appropriate data storage solution. We&rsquo;ll study its origins in the Amazon Dynamo project and Google&rsquo;s BigTable, and learn how its architecture helps us achieve the gold standard of scalability: horizontal scalability on commodity hardware. You&rsquo;ll leave prepared to begin experimenting with Cassandra immediately and planning its adoption in your next project.</p><p><strong>Per request, the presentation slides won&rsquo;t be made available</strong>.</p>

					<p>Tim is a full-stack generalist and passionate teacher who loves coding, presenting, and working with people. He believes the best developer is one who is well-informed of specifics and can also make deep connections between software development and the broader world. He has recently been exploring non-relational data stores, build systems, and how software architecture should resemble an ant colony.</p><p>His firm, the <a href="http://augusttechgroup.com/">August Technology Group</a>, helps clients with product development, technology consulting, and technology upgrade projects on the JVM. The August Group&rsquo;s technology preferences reflect the generalist sensibilities of its founder, and its development practices are always lightweight, self-improving, and humanizing by design.</p><p>Tim is a speaker internationally and on the <a href="http://nofluffjuststuff.com/">No Fluff Just Stuff</a> tour in the United States, and is co-president of the <a href="http://denveropensource.org/">Denver Open Source User Group</a>, author of the open-source <a href="http://github.com/tlberglund/groovy-liquibase">Groovy Liquibase DSL</a>, co-author of the <a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/functional-programming-clojure">DZone Clojure RefCard</a>, co-presenter of the best-selling <a href="http://bit.ly/ogitvid">O&rsquo;Reilly Git Master Class</a>, co-author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/144930463X">Building and Testing with Gradle</a>, and a member of the <a href="http://oreilly.com/pub/expert/timberglund">O&rsquo;Reilly Expert Network</a>.</p><p>He lives in Littleton, CO with the wife of his youth and their three children. </p>
