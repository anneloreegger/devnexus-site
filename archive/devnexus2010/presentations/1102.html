				<p>The asynchronous nature of GWT development requires a new way of thinking, especially for long-time server-side Web developers. How to notify views of changes to the model? Communicate between views? Cache data from service calls? And how to avoid UI spaghetti code? In this talk, you&rsquo;ll get a close-up look at a real-world app using the Model View Presenter pattern as implemented by the gwt-presenter and gwt-dispatch frameworks. We&rsquo;ll cover the event bus, decoupling presenters and views, making secure service calls with the Command pattern, and how GWT+MVP supports caching and an Undo feature. Learn what MVP is all about and whether it&rsquo;s right for you.</p>
