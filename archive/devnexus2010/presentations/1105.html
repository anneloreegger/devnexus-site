				<p>This session is aimed at helping developers get started with<br/>automating the collection of software quality metrics. We&rsquo;ll cover<br/>continuous integration, automated code metrics gathering, and analysis<br/>of these metrics. The ability to be able to detect problems early, and<br/>also to write higher quality code early, helps avoid bugs and headache<br/>down the line. We&rsquo;ll cover some best practices around using and<br/>putting in tools to help achieve higher quality.</p><p>This course centers around two freely available tools for maintaining<br/>high quality codebases. The first is Hudson, a continuous integration<br/>server. The second is Sonar, a code metrics server. In this session,<br/>we&rsquo;ll discuss best practices and then put them into use by setting up<br/>and running these tools. We&rsquo;ll also talk about tips for getting the<br/>most out of these tools. If you aren&rsquo;t using these tools in<br/>development, you absolutely need to come to this session - it will<br/>help make your life easier and impress your boss too!</p>
