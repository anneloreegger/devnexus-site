				<p>As the complexity of web applications continues to grow, the development tools provided to those creating such apps have remained, to a large extent, stagnant. The difficultly of adding the next &ldquo;killer&rdquo; feature while keeping load times reasonable and code size small can drive any Javascript guru to the brink of insanity. Google Web Toolkit provides tools that allow you to maintain your sanity and approach web development in the same manner you would any other large scale project. And much like any other set of tools, there are various ways to approach a project; some more efficient and scalable than others. The goal of &ldquo;GWT Best Practices&rdquo; is to take a deeper dive into slick ways to reduce code size, minimize RPC overhead, and streamline application development and testing using the MVP architecture within your GWT app.</p>
