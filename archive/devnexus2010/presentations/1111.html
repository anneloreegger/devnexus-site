				<p>Google AppEngine is a developer&rsquo;s dream: one-button deployment, no servers to configure, and ultimate scalabilty. To get these benefits, however, you must learn to design within AppEngine&rsquo;s constraints: no threads, no relational database, and a JRE whitelist, to name a few.<br/>This presentation offers a peek inside a real-world GWT application deployed on AppEngine. We&rsquo;ll look at working with the AppEngine database (including version upgrade considerations), how to do<br/>background processing absent thread support, designing for quotas, and discuss one developer&rsquo;s overall experience launching a startup on AppEngine.</p>
