				<p>The newly formed JBoss GateIn project promises to deliver a scalable and intuitive portal solution. I will show developers how to get started with GateIn and how to navigate and administer the portal and portlets. I will also demonstrate how to skin the portal to look like a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; web application that delivers content management, authentication, social capabilities and many other services.<br/>If time allows, I will also dive into the JBoss Portlet Bridge project which allows you to run a Seam, Richfaces, or normal JSF application as a portlet.</p>
