				<p>JSR-299: Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java EE is an elegant set of new services for Java that draws upon ideas from JBoss Seam and Google Guice. While many of the features provided (dependency injection, contextual lifecycle, configuration, interception, event notification) are familiar, the innovative use of meta-annotations is uniquely expressive and typesafe.</p><p>Seam is a powerful open source development platform for building rich Internet applications in Java. Seam is built on a JSR-299: Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java EE core (provided by Weld in JBoss Application Server), which integrates with Java EE technologies like JavaServer Faces (JSF) and Enterprise Java Beans (EJB 3.0). Seam integrates technologies such as Java Persistence (JPA), Business Process Management (BPM), Rules (Drools), Wicket, PDF and Excel reporting, Security and email into a unified full-stack solution, complete with sophisticated tooling.</p>
