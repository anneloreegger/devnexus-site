				<p>Java is a well established language, that has been around for more than a decade. Yet, programming on it has its challenges. There are concepts and<br/>features that are tricky. When you run into those, the compiler is not there to help you. In this presentation we will look at various concepts that you will use in<br/>general programming with Java. We will discuss the issues with those and how you can improve your code. We will look at concepts you can do better and<br/>those you should outright avoid.</p>
