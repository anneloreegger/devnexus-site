				<p>The Java EE 6 platform is an extreme makeover from the previous versions. It is developed as JSR 316 under the Java Community Process.</p><p>The Java EE 6 platform adds more power to the platform and yet make it more flexible so that it can be adopted to different flavors of an application. It breaks the &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; approach with Profiles and improves on the Java EE 5 developer productivity features. It enables extensibility by embracing open source libraries and frameworks such that they are treated as first class citizens of the platform.</p><p>Several new specifications such as Java Server Faces 2.0, Servlet 3.0, Java Persistence API 2.0, and Context and Dependency Injection 1.0 are included in the platform. All these specifications are implemented in GlassFish v3 that provides a light-weight, modular, and extensible platform for your Web applications.</p><p>This session provides an overview of Java EE 6 and its Reference Implementation - GlassFish v3. Using multiple simple-to-understand samples it explains the value proposition provided by Java EE 6.</p>
