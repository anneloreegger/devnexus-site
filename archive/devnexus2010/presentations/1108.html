				<p>All development organizations eventually converge on a set of tools to reduce costs, lower onboarding time, and leverage knowledge in strong communities to create standard processes. To this end we see in many organizations the emergence of a standard development stack consisting of Maven, M2Eclipse, Nexus &amp; Hudson. In this talk, Jason van Zyl will discuss the future of Maven and specifically Maven 3.x, the rapidly approaching M2Eclipse 1.0 release, the recent Nexus 1.5 release and roadmap, and the emergence of tools like Maven Shell and Polyglot Maven. Sonatype itself leverages this stack on a daily basis and this discussion will focus not only on the tools individually, but how they can work together to create a best practices approach to building and delivering your software in your organization.</p>
