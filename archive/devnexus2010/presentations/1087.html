				<p>The success of Web 2.0 and the popularity of mobile applications has revealed an important fact. Having an engaging or otherwise compelling user experience is critical to an application&rsquo;s success. Given a choice, people will replace an application they find difficult to use with something that&rsquo;s easier; even if the replacement doesn&rsquo;t do everything the original did. Some businesses bring in professional User Experience Designers in an attempt to deal with this issue. The problem is that most designers don&rsquo;t actually write code, and running code is the key factor in determining what kind of user experience your customers have.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why it is critical that you understand the principles and fundamentals presented in this talk. You&rsquo;ll leave with a better handle on what user experience is, and what you can do to ensure your application delivers the best possible user experience to your customers.</p>
