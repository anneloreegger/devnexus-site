				<p>Grails is the ultimate Java rapid application development environment (RAD). Using the lightweight but powerful Groovy language sitting on top of the JVM, you can put together a complete application in a fraction of time as &ldquo;normal&rdquo; web-app development. This introductory session to Grails will cover the new Grails 1.2 release using lots of<br/>code examples. We&rsquo;ll use The new Eclipse-Groovy/Grails plugin to create a complete app during the session. We&rsquo;ll also use some of the <em>hundreds</em> of plugins available for Grails. These plugins offer<br/>easy-to-use features such as rich internet, security, clustering, etc.</p>
