				<p>By combining Spring and Flex developers can quickly build multi-screen apps for smart phones, tablets, TVs, and PCs. Using Spring developers can build back-end services which can easily be reused no matter how data is being rendered on the client. On the client-side Flex provides reusable components with a variety of skins to support differing size constraints and interaction models. This session will help developers get up-to-speed on how they can use these technologies to create an application abstraction layer across the ever growing plethora of devices that our apps need to support.</p>
