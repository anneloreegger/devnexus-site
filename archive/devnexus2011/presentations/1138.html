				<p>Securing today&rsquo;s applications is often a painful and confusing<br/>process, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be. Apache Shiro is a flexible<br/>open-source security framework that simplies the four cornerstones of<br/>application security: authentication, authorization, enterprise session management and cryptography. With Shiro’s easy-to-understand API, you can quickly and easily secure any application – from the smallest mobile applications to the largest web and enterprise applications.</p><p>Les Hazlewood, Apache Shiro PMC Chair, will explain all of Shiro&rsquo;s<br/>core features and demonstrate how to secure your own applications<br/>successfully and easily.</p>
