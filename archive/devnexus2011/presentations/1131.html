				<p>Google AppEngine lets you build and host scalable Web applications written in Python or Java on Google&rsquo;s infrastructure. We&rsquo;ll look at how to build and deploy a GWT+GAE application with Google Plugin for Eclipse and take a look at sample code for a GWT+GAE app using the Datastore with objectify-appengine. We&rsquo;ll also look at two new AppEngine features: multitenancy (Datastore namespaces) and browser push using the Channel API.</p><p>Guest speaker Mike Lawrence (Manager Web Architecture at theice.com) will also demo an app (<a href="http://goo.gl/UT2W3">http://goo.gl/UT2W3</a>) created and hosted on Google App Engine.</p>
