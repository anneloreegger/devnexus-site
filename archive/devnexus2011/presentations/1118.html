				<p>Refactoring is one of the most powerful tools for improving the intrinsic quality of any code base. Yet, as important as refactoring is, non-technical business stakeholders tend to see little value in the practice. After struggling for a decade to articulate refactoring in such a way that the ROI was obvious, I finally stumbled upon an analogy that seems to work: Building with Lego vs. Play-Doh. In this presentation I will demonstrate the techniques I use to turn an apprehensive room of business owners into the biggest supporters of refactoring in your organization.</p>

					<p>As I enter my 18th year of developing software, several recurring trends and forces have become obvious to me. My day job as a technical lead affords me time in the evening to write articles and prepare talks around these trends and forces, all of which interest me greatly. To date these talks include &ldquo;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/NeilGreen1/the-roi-of-refactoring-lego-vs-playdoh">The ROI of Refactoring</a>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<a href="http://devnexus.com/static/2012/audio/105 - Neil Green - Nothing matters more than coding fast.mp3">Nothing Matters More Than Coding Fast</a>&rdquo;, and most recently &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm4jEcnWeKI">Writing Custom DSLs</a>&rdquo; - which was a sneaky way to speak about these trends and forces in the form of technical talk. </p>
