				<p>The power of JBoss is now available through the expressiveness of Ruby. More and more projects are suited to new technologies and frameworks such as Ruby on Rails.</p><p>Using TorqueBox, an organization can leverage their knowledge, investment, skills, and trust in JBoss, while exploring the cutting edge of new development models.</p><p>TorqueBox supports any Rack-based web framework, including Ruby on<br/>Rails and Sinatra. Rubyists now get excellent and time-tested Java components such as HornetQ, Infinispan and Quartz using familiar idioms and patterns.</p><p>This presentation will cover general Ruby web-framework support and introduce the use of enterprise<br/>JBoss services with only a few lines of Ruby.</p>
