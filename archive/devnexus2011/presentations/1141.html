				<p>This is a fairly advanced talk about some of the more ambitious things you can do in a functional language (closures are just the beginning). It deals with the quite tricky subject of continuations by sneaking up on it by incremental steps building on single function tail recursion, multiple function tail recursion with trampolines, and then on to the continuations compiler plugin and support libraries in Scala.</p>
