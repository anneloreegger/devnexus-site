				<p>Applications are increasingly facing demands for horizontal scalability and cross-platform interoperability. NoSQL data stores are gaining momentum as a way to address the scalability challenges. Messaging systems, on the other hand, are by their very nature able to handle widely distributed deployment models, but for Java developers, the cross-platform challenge suggests we should look beyond JMS. Open protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, and AMQP are attractive language-neutral alternatives.</p><p>In this session, you will learn how the Spring application platform is evolving to accommodate these trends. We&rsquo;ll explore the Spring Data APIs for working with a variety of NoSQL data stores, and we&rsquo;ll compare and contrast several open protocol options for both synchronous and asynchronous messaging via Spring Integration Gateways and Channel Adapters.</p>
