				<p>The Spring AMQP project&rsquo;s goal is to simplify development of messaging applications based on the AMQP protocol. Spring AMQP provides convenient abstractions that promote a POJO based programming model. If you are familiar with Spring&rsquo;s JMS support, you will feel right at home. In this session, we will begin with a quick overview of AMQP itself. Then, we will take a tour of Spring AMQP features such as publishing messages, converting message content, and creating multithreaded consumers. The session will include several demos using the RabbitMQ broker.</p>
