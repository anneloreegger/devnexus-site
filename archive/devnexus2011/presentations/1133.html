				<p>Presentation to be held together with Keith Donald.</p><p>With the rising prevalence of smart mobile platforms such as iPhone and Android, the desire for rich mobile clients as another means of accessing enterprise services is something that can no longer be ignored. In this session, we will cover the new Spring Mobile project to see what the Spring community is doing to simplify mobile application development. As we go, we will explore the current mobile development landscape and analyze native vs. mobile web vs. hybrid architectural choices. You will learn how to add &ldquo;mobile web&rdquo; capabilities to your Java Spring MVC apps, how to integrate native apps with RESTful backends, and how to integrate leading native bridging and cross-platform UI frameworks.</p>
