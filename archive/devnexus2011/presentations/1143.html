				<p>Bookstore shelves and training catalogs are stuffed with options for learning about the theory and principle behind Agile Software Development. In reading through a book or attending a Scrum certification class, the description of the process seems to flow like water. However, when enthusiasts attempt to make that flow a reality in the workplace, it becomes all to clear just how much tactical how-to was left out of the material. Attendees of this talk will see how to make the trickier bits of Scrum possible, including answers to questions like &ldquo;Exactly how do I go about planning a sprint?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How do I get my team to start using story points?&rdquo;, all distilled from Barry&rsquo;s years in the field of making this happen in a range of corporate environments.</p>
