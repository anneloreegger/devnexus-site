				<p>Things are changing. Just a few years ago, building a web application meant shipping HTML to a user&rsquo;s single computer. Today, your users are likely to have two, three, or even more devices, and expect to be able to get access to your application from their computer, their couch, or on the go. In this talk, Yehuda will explore this new world, and how you should plan your next web application, or how you should plan the next year of development on your existing app.</p>
