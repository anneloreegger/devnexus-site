				<p>Web Toolkit (GWT) lets you build and optimize rich browser-based apps without having to be an expert in browser quirks, XMLHttpRequest, or JavaScript. In this talk, we&rsquo;ll look at GWT’s new application framework, including Activities and Places (MVP), the EventBus, the RequestFactory persistence framework, and data binding with the Editor framework. It time permits, we’ll also look at the new lightweight widgets for table rendering and GWT tools including GWT Designer for Eclipse and SpeedTracer.</p>
