				<p>For our production code we apply a wealth of design values and principles. Currently this is rarely done for our builds. Yet the project automation domain, specially in the enterprise, is often at least as complex as the business domain. The design of a build is also heavily influenced and possibly constrained by the design of the build system you are using. </p><p>The build systems under review (Ant. Maven, Gradle) are dramatically different and thus the design of the corresponding builds. We will talk about best practices for build design and how different build systems might support that or stand in the way, thus preventing expressive, maintainable and easy to use builds. Those differences should be a major factor when you are choosing a build system appropriate to your needs.</p><p>The presentation is available at: </p><p><a href="https://prezi.com/secure/6fb2b21de9c6c1b9247a5f4007849e3d4e8814d3/">https://prezi.com/secure/6fb2b21de9c6c1b9247a5f4007849e3d4e8814d3/</a></p>
