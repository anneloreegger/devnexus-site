				<p>Gradle allows you to describe your build using a rich, easily extendable build language based on Groovy. It provides compelling solutions for many of the big pain points that exist with current build systems. This session will be mostly driven by live demos. You will see how easy and elegant Gradle enables you to solve a broad range of requirements - over the full life cycle of typical and atypical Java builds and will include many of the new and upcoming 1.0 features.</p><p>The demos span Gradle&rsquo;s revised dependency management, environment specific multi-project builds, the new Maven import feature, IDE integration, test result analysis, code sharing, parallel testing, incremental builds, &hellip;</p>
