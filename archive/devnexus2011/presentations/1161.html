				<p>Java is a great programming language but it&rsquo;s not supported on all mobile platforms. Using the open source GWT Java-&gt;JavaScript compiler and the PhoneGap build tool, you can create mobile applications in Java that run on virtually all smartphone operating systems including webOS, Android, BlackBerry, and iOS. This session will cover how to get started with GWT and PhoneGap, then build a few real world applications that properly adapt to different devices with a single codebase.</p>
