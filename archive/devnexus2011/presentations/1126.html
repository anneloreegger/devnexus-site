				<p>NoSQL (or NOSQL or Not Only SQL) is the moniker given to a new wave of data storage systems that have emerged within the past few years. It is often criticized for being too broad a category, but after thirty years of the relational database being the instinctive choice for data storage, publicizing the concept that One Size Does Not Fit All is a good thing. This talk will present an introduction to the systems and discuss the design patterns and tradeoffs commonly seen.</p>
