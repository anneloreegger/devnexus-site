				<p>Many development shops have made the leap from RCS, Perforce, ClearCase, PVCS, CVS, BitKeeper or SourceSafe to the modern Subversion (SVN) version control system. But why not take the next massive stride in productivity and get on board with Git, a distributed version control system. Jump ahead of the masses staying on Subversion, and increase your team&rsquo;s productivity, debugging effectiveness, flexibility in cutting releases, and repository and connectivity redundancy (at $0 cost). Understand how distributed version control systems (DVCSes) are game-changers and pick up the lingo that will become standard in the next few years.</p><p>In this talk, we discuss the team changes that liberate you from the central server, but still conform the corporate expectation that there&rsquo;s a central master repository. You&rsquo;ll get a cheat sheet for Git, and a trail-map from someone who&rsquo;s actually experienced the Subversion to Git transition.</p><p>Lastly, we&rsquo;ll even expose how you can leverage 75% of Git&rsquo;s features against a Subversion repository without ever telling your bosses you are using it (they&rsquo;ll start to wonder why you are so much more effective in your checkins than other members of your team though).</p>
