				<p>Organizations are increasingly recognizing the value of connecting their applications to popular services their users use each and every day. Spring Social is a new project in the Spring community that lets you integrate your application with popular &ldquo;Software as a Service&rdquo; (SaaS) providers such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Github, Flickr, and Gowalla. In this session, you will learn exactly what Spring Social offers and see how to apply it to your own applications. You will also see how to extend the framework to support new service provider APIs as they emerge.</p>
