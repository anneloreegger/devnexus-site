				<p>In this session, we&rsquo;ll address the missing link in Enterprise Java development: simple, easy integration testing.</p><p>Unit tests and mock objects will only take you so far; the only answer which truly ensures that all components are playing nicely is a comprehensive integration suite. Unfortunately, writing integration tests has historically involved manual setup of a heavy, cumbersome test harness. That&rsquo;s time lost, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be anymore.</p><p>Here we&rsquo;ll introduce Arquillian, a powerful container-oriented testing framework layered atop TestNG and JUnit. Arquillian manages your runtime, abstracting out deployment and allowing you to focus on real test logic. We&rsquo;ll cover:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Transparent container lifecycle management</li>
  <li>Declarative deployments</li>
  <li>Test Enrichment (Dependency injection intotests)</li>
  <li>In-container test execution</li>
</ul><p>Attend this talk to learn how the simplified component model of Java EE can be applied to testable development.</p><p>The presentation is available at: </p><p><a href="http://portal.sliderocket.com/APHAU/devnexus03222011_arquillian_invasion">http://portal.sliderocket.com/APHAU/devnexus03222011_arquillian_invasion</a></p>
