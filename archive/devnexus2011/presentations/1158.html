				<p>Target Audience: Intermediate and Senior Java OO Programmers</p><p>Selenium is a powerful and dangerous testing tool, whether you are using Se 1 (which leverages the browser Javascript sandbox) or the emerging Se 2 (which drives browsers externally, and natively from the OS). If you are writing Selenium RC Java code right now, it might suffer from severe brittleness of the kind described here: </p><p><a href="http://patrickwilsonwelsh.com/?p=47">http://patrickwilsonwelsh.com/?p=47</a></p><p>In Se 1, you can learn to adopt patterns and practices described here: </p><p><a href="http://patrickwilsonwelsh.com/?p=332">http://patrickwilsonwelsh.com/?p=332</a><br/><a href="http://patrickwilsonwelsh.com/?p=343">http://patrickwilsonwelsh.com/?p=343</a><br/><a href="http://patrickwilsonwelsh.com/?p=381">http://patrickwilsonwelsh.com/?p=381</a></p><p>By keeping the inherent Domain Specific Languages in your Se 1 Java codebases separate, by keeping the framework code DRY (Don&rsquo;t Repeat Yourself), and allowing the actual test scenarios to become &ldquo;wet&rdquo; in the interest of expressiveness, you can drastically lower the TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) of your Selenium testing efforts. </p><p>This presentation will consist mostly of slide and code presentations, with opportunities for some mob programming of real Se test scenarios. Come prepared to read and write Java code. </p>

					<p>With over 30 years of professional software development experience, I&rsquo;ve worn a lot of hats. Over the last 7 years or so I&rsquo;ve worked as an agile consultant, specializing in building development teams, and training and mentoring them in agile development and agile testing practices. I&rsquo;ve worked mostly in Java. Currently focusing on Storytesting as a struggling agile practice meme. </p><p>In the past I&rsquo;ve also been an entrepreneur, producer, project manager, composer, and sound designer for award-winning games and multimedia titles for CD-ROM and the web. I&rsquo;ve been a user interface designer for interactive television. I spent my first ten years in software as a technical writer, marketing writer, and manager of writers. Writing, speaking, teaching, mentoring, community-building, recruiting, and selling are what I am best at, however diligently I work at the craft of programming, which I certainly do.</p>
