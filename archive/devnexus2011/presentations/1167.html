				<p>Do you want your next project to be more than just a web page? SproutCore gives you the tools to build immersive, data-rich applications. With a powerful data-binding layer, SproutCore frees you up to think about manipulating the underlying data, and not have to worry about handling all of the edge-cases that start to pile up as you add more elements to your view.</p><p>In this talk, Yehuda will walk you through developing a SproutCore application and show you how declaratively describing your views can keep you sane while developing a rich JavaScript application.</p>
