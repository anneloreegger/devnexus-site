    <div class="presentation-body">
      Spring Boot 2 and Spring Framework 5 have arrived and they deliver on a key promise: Supporting Reactive programming using Reactor 3.1 to model non-blocking flows. 

More than learning about a new framework, the developer is challenged with a new mindset. In this Workshop, we aim to deliver the survival kit to understand reactive programming trade-off, when to choose it and read/write Reactor flows. In the context of Spring Boot 2, we'll be exploring some of the ecosystem support like web, data and security.
