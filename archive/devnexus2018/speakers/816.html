      In this talk we’ll cover all aspects of Java Vulnerabilities. We’ll explain why Java has this dubious reputation, what’s being done to address the issues and what you have to do to reduce your exposure. You’ll learn about Java vulnerabilities in general: how they are reported, managed and fixed as well as learning about the specifics of attack vectors and just what a ‘vulnerability’ actually is.
