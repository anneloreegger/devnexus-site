      Sometimes we are not sure if using a specific tool is a good decision or not. How many libraries are available in the market? What will become standard? And, what is just a hype?

PWA sounds like a new framework, or a tool to create some sort of web apps. Many developers link it to JavaScript, and that is only achievable with one of those new framework.js out there.
