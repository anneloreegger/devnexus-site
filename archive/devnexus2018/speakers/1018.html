      Humanity is entering a new age of space exploration focusing beyond Earth orbit. Deep space mission design organizations such as NASA face new mission goals with complex custom computing and visualization requirements. Modern technology platforms such as JavaFX and Java 8 enable these intricate workflows.  The complexities of trajectory design within deep space regimes will be discussed.  Examples range from missions to liquid-rich worlds such as Europa and Enceladus, but also humanity's return to the Moon via excursion missions to the planned Deep Space Gateway. 
Science orbits in these vicinities involve significant computational challenges due to complex gravitational effects.  Demonstrations will include the Deep Space Trajectory Explorer (DSTE), software designed completely in JavaFX and Java 8 providing rapid parallel search and filtration capabilities. Custom hardware-accelerated visualizations are used to visually identify trajectory solutions that exploit these dense gravity fields. The DSTE immerses the user within the design space, letting the data be the interface to the user.  Data visualizations will feature a mix of custom multilayered 2D plots and interactive 3D tools.

      Humanity is turning its gaze beyond Earth orbit, seeking to become a multiworld species. NASA missions to Earth's moon, moons of Jupiter and Saturn and nearby asteroids are in development now. The complexities of the trajectory design for these missions present an overwhelming design space. The JavaFX based Deep Space Trajectory Explorer provides custom 2D/3D visualizations. Often the  design space however demands more computing power than available on a single system. Gluon's CloudLink provisioning provides a crucial yet elegant bridge to Oracle Cloud Platform and Bare Metal resources enabling mission success. Demonstration will include data related to manned Lunar surface excursion missions via the Deep Space Gateway.
