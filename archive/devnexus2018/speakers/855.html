    <div class="presentation-body">
      This talk goes behind the scenes of an enterprise-level MyAccount Mobile App for a wireless company that was developed using the hybrid approach. It gives a high-level technical overview of the convoluted ecosystem that is made up of a mix of new and legacy components.  It then dives into the details of Apache Cordova which "wraps" the regular web app and transforms it into the mobile app.  It will also highlight and demonstrate the deployment and testing aspects during the integration cycle, and will show the steps of how to use the Android debugger, adb, to perform device-level debugging to solve an SSL certificate issue.
