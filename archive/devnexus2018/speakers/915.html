    <div class="presentation-body">
      Already familiar with the Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts and features? Then you're ready for the next step! Now you need to learn how Kubernetes and a Service Mesh (Istio) can provide you out-of-box and transparently features like service discovery, load balancing, tracing, and circuit breaking. Without having to add a single line of code or @Annotation!

Come to this workshop to build your own small cluster of Java Microservices with Spring Boot and Eclipse Vert.x on top of Kubernetes/OpenShift and Istio. Then you will be able to unleash your developer powers on your project without having to worry too much with your infrastructure details anymore!

    <div class="presentation-body">
      We automated our deployment pipelines. We do blue/green and canary deployments. Now we need the next step to reach another level of software releases. Now we want to test our business hypothesis. Two different approaches outstand in this area: smart routers and feature toggles. We'll have it covered.

Come to this session to see lots of demos and deployments with smart routers and feature toggles to check how effective A/B testing can be achieved. Of course A/B testing is nothing without monitoring, so we'll a monitoring platform setup and integrated for everything! You may be thinking about A/B, but after this session we'll get you from A to Z.

    <div class="presentation-body">
      Do you have that feeling that no matter how much network speed gets faster, web pages always taker longer do load? It's 2017 and don't we already have a solution for this? In fact we do! The solution goes through HTTP/2 and Reactive Systems.

Join us on this session and we'll discuss the limitations of HTTP/1.1 and the new improvements brought to us by HTTP/2. But just HTTP/2 is not enough! We need to rearchitect part of our applications to allow higher concurrency and lower response times. We also need to be reactive: expects lots of demos and explore how Vert.x and HTTP/2 can solve the sluggish webapps problem.
