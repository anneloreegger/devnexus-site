      “Microservces are small services with independent lifecycles that work together” -Sam Newman. In this talk I'll be presenting some core principles I think represent what makes microservices work well using Node.JS and Docker.  We’ll explore best practices, code, and tooling to get the job done right. I'd say that beginners will get a sense of what microservices are and what makes different, whereas more experienced practitioners will get an insight into practical advice into how to implement them.
