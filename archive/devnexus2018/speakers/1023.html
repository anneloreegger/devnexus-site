    <div class="presentation-body">
      Java 8 introduced the Stream API as a modern, functional, and very powerful tool for processing collections of data. One of the main benefits of the Stream API is that it hides the details of iteration over the underlying data set, allowing for parallel processing within a single JVM, using a fork/join framework.
