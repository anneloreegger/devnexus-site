				<p>While the highest priority of an agile team is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of “valuable” software, the measure of progress is delivery of “working” software.  The conflict between the terms “valuable” and “working” have led to teams creating “business” stories that add value and “technical” stories that are a perceived nuisance.  The result is an unnecessary conflict between executives, business units, developers and operations that agile is meant to prevent.  During this session we will discuss techniques to follow agile principles while ensuring all stakeholder’s needs are met.</p>
