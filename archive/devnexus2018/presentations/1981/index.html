				<p>A flat backlog presents problems understanding context of individual items.  Determining the value of a user story in a vacuum is difficult, if not impossible.  We need the big picture!  User story mapping is a technique that can help us keep the big picture front and center.  We will discuss the challenges with flat backlogs, how user story mapping can help with those, do an activity to build a story map and discuss how to integrate this technique into the work youâ€™re already doing.</p>
