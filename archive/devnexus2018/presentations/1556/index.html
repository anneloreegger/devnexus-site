				Abstract
			</div>
			<div class="biography-body">
				<p>Serverless and FaaS are rapidly establishing themselves as fundamental cloud services. Itâ€™s a radically simple model for deployment and management of code in the cloud.</p>

<p>As we willingly, happily sacrifice control over infrastructure and deployment, what else have we given up? The basics of FaaS seem pretty straightforward, but I think we need new knowledge, tools and techniques to make our FaaS apps really shine.</p>

      <p>Matthew is a (somewhat) functional programmer who enjoys all kinds of language nerdery as well as whisky.</p>

<p>He currently works on open-source code at Oracle, helping to make Java in the cloud be as good as it can.  If not there, you might find him at a local meetup, teaching kids to code, or away from computers hiking and running in Southwest England.</p>

<p>Past lives include OpenStacking, teaching English to highschoolers and a whole lot of Clojure and Java.</p>
