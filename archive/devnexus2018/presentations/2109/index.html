				<p>Navigating the pitfalls that often accompany Android development such as Scopes and Lifecycles, Activity vs Fragment vs “Smart” View, Orientation Changes, Async Calls, and Navigation can make really complicated and difficult-to-test code. React and Redux are technologies that are prevalent in the web world and have benefits such as a Single Source of truth, Predictable and testable behavior, Rewind/Fast Forward debugging, and Pure functions and objects, and in this talk, we’ll talk about how to gain these benefits in Android applications.</p>
