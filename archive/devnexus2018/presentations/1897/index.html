			<div class="biography-body">
				<p>At the core of asynchronous programming facility in Java is CompletableFuture. It provides two channels, one for data and one for error handling. Using a nice series of transformations we can work with data or deal with errors quite elegantly. In this presentation we will learn about the key problem CompletableFuture solves, how and when to use it, and also take a look at some problems that can be easily solved using it.</p>
