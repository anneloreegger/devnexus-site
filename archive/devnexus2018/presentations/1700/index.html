				<p>Do you have that feeling that no matter how much network speed gets faster, web pages always taker longer do load? It’s 2017 and don’t we already have a solution for this? In fact we do! The solution goes through HTTP/2 and Reactive Systems.</p>

<p>Join us on this session and we’ll discuss the limitations of HTTP/1.1 and the new improvements brought to us by HTTP/2. But just HTTP/2 is not enough! We need to rearchitect part of our applications to allow higher concurrency and lower response times. We also need to be reactive: expects lots of demos and explore how Vert.x and HTTP/2 can solve the sluggish webapps problem.</p>
