			<div class="biography-body">
				<p>This talk will examine NoSQL as an alternative to locally persisting data on mobile platforms. We will provide an overview of the various flavors of NoSQL, focusing on the  Document model. I will introduce Couchbase Lite, an open source, cross-platform NoSQL embedded data store for your mobile apps. We will compare and contrast it with existing embedded storage solutions. We will discuss how you can integrate this in your mobile apps and walk through examples describing the CRUD and Query interface.</p>
