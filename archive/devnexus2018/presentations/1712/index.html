				<p>In the first part of this workshop you’ll dive into Behavior Driven Development with Spock. Working through a sample project, you’ll gain experience with several of the core practices that make BDD so valuable to developers, including Domain Driven Design and Specification by Example. By the time you’re done, you’ll see for yourself how Spock and BDD can help you deliver higher quality code in less time.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, you’ll get up to speed wth JUnit 5. The difference between JUnit 4 and 5 is far bigger than the difference between 3 and 4. JUnit 5 was released in September so it is high time to learn about next generation JUnit. Come learn about the new features and the new styles of unit testing that JUnit 5 allows.</p>

<p>You’ll learn about:
   Writing clean code
   Writing good specifications and tests
   User acceptance tests, integration tests, and unit tests
   Pair, and mob, programming
   Life without the debugger</p>
