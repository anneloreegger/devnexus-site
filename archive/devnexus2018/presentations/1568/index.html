				Abstract

			<div class="biography-body">
				<p>Software craftsmanship began as a belief that our industry would work brilliantly if it was modelled on the medieval craft guilds of Europe. This metaphor proved popular enough that a community grew around it. As the community has grown, the meaning of software craftsmanship has evolved into something new. In this talk I’ll look at the ways in which software craftsmanship has evolved and what it means to be a software crafter today.</p>
