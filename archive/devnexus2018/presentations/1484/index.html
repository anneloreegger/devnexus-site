				<p>With support for every major browser (including mobile browsers) and bindings for many languages, there is no doubt that Selenium WebDriver is the most popular open source browser automation tool.

You can even execute tests in the cloud against different browser / OS combinations. Come to this session to learn how you can get the most out of Selenium WebDriver.</p>
