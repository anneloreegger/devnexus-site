				Abstract

			<div class="biography-body">
				<p>To introduce attendees to the basics of messaging queues, their goals and applications from CFML.  Messaging enables software applications to connect and scale. Thus, providing applications to connect to each other as components of a larger application, or to user devices and data. Messaging is asynchronous, and can decouple your software concerns with ease.  However, messaging is much more than the traditional publish/subscribe patterns but also the ability to create work queues, routing and much more.</p>
