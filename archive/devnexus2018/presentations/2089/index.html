				<p>Riff is an open source polyglot function service built using Kubernetes primitives that allows developers to focus on writing simple and portable units of code. Its unique approach to reactive event streaming enables computations such as time windowing.</p>

<p>Attend this demo-driven session to learn about the internal architecture of riff and how the use of patterns such as the function sidecar and layered container images help minimize the surface area of code function developers need to care about.</p>
