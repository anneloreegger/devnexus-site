				<p>How to build configurable, resilient, monitorable Java Microservices? Eclipse MicroProfile (https://microprofile.io/) is the answer. Eclipse MicroProfile has rapidly become a rich set of technologies essential for writing configurable, fault tolerant, secure and production-ready Java Microservices. This session will give you a quick overview on the capabilities available in MicroProfile 1.2, followed by a live demo of configurable and fault tolerant microservice coding example, running on Open Liberty (https://openliberty.io/).</p>
