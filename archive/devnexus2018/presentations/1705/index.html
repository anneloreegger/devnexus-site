				<p>The Java SE Platform and the JDK are moving to a rapid, six-month release cadence, with the next release in March 2018.  We’ll review the motivations for this change and discuss some of its consequences.  We’ll then take a look ahead at the pipeline of features currently in development in various projects in the OpenJDK Community including Amber, Panama, Valhalla, and Loom.</p>
