			<div class="biography-body">
				<p>The first generation of microservices was primarily shaped by Netflix OSS and leveraged by numerous Spring Cloud annotations all throughout your business logic. The next generation of microservices will leverage sidecars and a service mesh. In this session, we will give you a taste of Envoy and Istio, two open source projects that will change the way you write distributed, cloud native, Java applications on Kubernetes.  Traffic shaping, network fault-injection, A/B testing, dark launches and much more.</p>
