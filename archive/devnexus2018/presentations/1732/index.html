			<div class="biography-body">
				<p>Continuously delivery is central to every software-driven organization. If you’re doing this today or you’d like to learn or extend the practice to “data-centric applications”, you will find this demo-driven talk supplementing your current methods and as well as provide useful context for future developments.</p>

<p>In this talk, we will review Spring Cloud Data Flow and Spring Cloud Skipper and how they come together to solve data integration and the continuous delivery challenges respectively. The day-to-day developer workflow including development, testing, CI, and the overall orchestration on cloud platforms (e.g., Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes) will be demonstrated.</p>
