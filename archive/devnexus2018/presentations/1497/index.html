			<div class="biography-body">
				<p>Is it possible to set up a microservices application with a separate functioning front-end in 30 minutes? With JHipster 4 it is! And what you get is fully functional with a service registry that provides scalability and load balancing. Using provided Docker Compose configurations, the entire stack can be run locally without installing anything but Docker. JHipster also includes full monitoring using the ELK stack.</p>
