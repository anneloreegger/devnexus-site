				<p>This workshop will focus on the functional features introduced in Java 8 and the new capabilities added in Java 9. Topics from Java 8 will include both sequential and parallel streams, lambdas, method references, the Optional data type, functional interfaces, static and default methods in interfaces, collectors, and more. Topics from Java 9 will include the new module system using Jigsaw, the jshell REPL, private methods in interfaces, collection factory methods, and additions to the Stream, Optional, and CompletableFuture classes.</p>

<p>The examples and exercises will highlight the ways to write idiomatic Java using the new features. All code will be available in a GitHub repository, including Gradle build files and test cases. Coding will use the IntelliJ IDEA editor, but Eclipse support will be discussed.</p>

<p>Participants are expected to be comfortable with, though not necessarily experts using, versions of Java prior to Java 8.</p>
