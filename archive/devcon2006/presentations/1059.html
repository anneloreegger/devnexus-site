				<p>Dynamic User Interfaces With JavaServer. Faces and AJAX JavaServer. Faces can be used to create highly dynamic Asynchronous JavaScript. technology and XML (AJAX) sites. In this session we&rsquo;ll take a look at how AJAX and JavaServer Faces can be used together to create dynamic components. We will examine some of the features in the JavaServer Faces 1.2 specification (as well as JavaServer Faces 2.0 specification proposals) that facilitate the use of AJAX. We&rsquo;ll also take a look at some of the dynamic components available, as well as a complete application, and we&rsquo;ll see how JavaScript. libraries such as Dojo can be used.</p>
