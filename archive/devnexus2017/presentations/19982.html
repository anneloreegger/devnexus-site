				<p>Everybody is talking about microservices and reactive programming these days. And there’s a reason for that: the high-demand and high-scale distributed world that we have today, reacting to events in an asynchronous and non-blocking fashion seems the right approach to deal with scalability. And to achieve microservices you need a lightweight, fast, modular, high-performance and un-opinionated environment. Meet Vert.x: a toolkit for building reactive applications on the JVM.</p><p>Come to this session to see how you can use Vert.x to create reactive code using Java, Groovy, JavaScript or other JVM languages. We’ll demonstrate how to build Vert.x-based systems leveraging the unique Vert.x event bus for creating apps with real-time communications from the modern web browser to the cloud and back again. Have fun with a large number of live demonstrations that will cause you to reconsider your reliance on monolithics and consider leaving tradition behind for an event-driven, reactive, microservice-focused architecture.</p>
