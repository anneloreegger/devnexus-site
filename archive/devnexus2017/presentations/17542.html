				<p>Designers and developers often contribute to the same project. And yet it is often the case that little time is spent on determining how the working relationship will&hellip;er&hellip;work. Whether you are a developer or designer at a product company, an independent contractor, or as part of a team of consultants, you will leave this session with new techniques to streamline your “dev+sign” process. At Big Nerd Ranch we’ve forged a process where Android/iOS/Web developers and designers work hand-in-hand throughout the life of a project to support each other in creating the most awesome mobile and web apps possible. We will walk you through real examples from the trenches (names will be changes to protect the innocent!) and share details about processes we follow to solve problems we have faced in creating apps for our clients.</p>
