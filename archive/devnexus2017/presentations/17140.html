				<p>In Java 9, the G1GC will become the default collector and the mostly CMS collector will be deprecated. The hype is that the G1GC is suppose to be easier to tune. In this session we will explore the reality by looking at the performance implications of moving to the G1 collector. The session will draw upon experiences with tuning the collector in production environments. This isnâ€™t simply about performance. A sub-optimally tuned collector will increase your companies operating cost by 10-20%. We will also explore results from benchmarks that expose potential pain points. and offer some suggestions on what actions can offer some relief.</p>
