				<p>As developers and consultants, much of your career is spent learning how to properly manage your relationship with managers and clients.  What happens when you take that next step, perhaps as part of starting your own business, and now need to manage customer relations instead?  How is this different from your previous roles and how can you deal with the difficult situations that will arise?  Come learn from first-hand experience what to expect, how to answer the question that is meant - not the one that is asked, and how to effectively communicate with your customers, while always smiling from the wrists down.</p>
