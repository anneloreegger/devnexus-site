				<p>&quot;Scala is hard to read -and way more confusing than Java”, “Erlang is impossible for many reasons, but how is Elixir better?” “OpenStack doesn’t scale”, “Platforms are so opinionated, why would I want to try Cloud Foundry? BOSH is a mess” … and so many more..<br/> <br/>We&rsquo;ve all heard comments like this, usually uttered in disgust over a drink during an event reception hour—for the very project being criticized. <br/> <br/>Every open source project and community has its headaches. Criticisms about governance, roadmap and focus are often simply the downsides of the very advantages open source provides: transparency, inclusiveness, and agility. And other criticisms can often be unmasked as groundless, ill-informed, or already in the process of remediation.</p><p>In this panel, however, a group of open source insiders will take an honest, unvarnished look at several critiques common to most open source projects, then offer ideas on how we can address them. </p>
