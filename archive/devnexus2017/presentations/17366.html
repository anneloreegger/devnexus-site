				<p>Moar puzzlers! The more we work with Java 8, the more we go into the rabbit hole. Did they add all those streams, lambdas, monads, Optionals and CompletableFutures only to confuse us? It surely looks so! And Java 9 that heads our way brings even more of what we like the most, more puzzlers, of course! In this season we as usual have a great batch of the best Java WTF, great jokes to present them and great prizes for the winners!</p>
