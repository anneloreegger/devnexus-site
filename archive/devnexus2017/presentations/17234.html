				<p>Microservice and SOA architectures are becoming increasingly common today, even in traditional environments. As your systems grow more distributed, you&rsquo;ll face challenges beyond those seen in monolithic applications. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Static property files and other simple techniques become too unwieldy to effectively manage configuration, especially for sensitive properties such as passwords.</li>
  <li>As instances of a service come or go due to scaling, migration, or failure, the things which depend on that service need a way to find a valid current location.</li>
  <li>With so much new inter-process communication, it is important to secure the REST and middleware traffic connecting your services.</li>
</ul><p>In this session, we&rsquo;ll look at modern tools like Consul and Vault for solving these problems of service discovery and monitoring, configuration management, and security. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Discuss the advantages of smart DNS over traditional load balancers.</li>
  <li>Walk through some approaches for centralizing the configuration of all your services.</li>
  <li>Show how to use Vault as a private certificate authority, for powerful control over your internal SSL communication.</li>
</ul><p>Steve and Amit will approach the topic from an application development perspective and a DevOps perspective, respectively. We&rsquo;ll cover popular abstraction layers such as Spring Cloud Config, but focus on framework-agnostic solutions.</p>
