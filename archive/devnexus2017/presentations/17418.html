				<p>At some point you or someone on your team will make a mistake. It’s a question of when, not if. Luckily, you’re using Git! Now you need to know, how exactly do you undo that snafu?</p><p>Tobiah Zarlez will teach you what you need to know from undoing local changes and amending commit messages, to cleaning up your commits and the power of branching with git rebase. More importantly, he will explain the why and how these solutions do what they do, not just list which commands to use in what order.</p><p>This talked will be aimed at developers who are getting started with git and/or are only accustomed to using the most basic of commands. Git has a lot of very handy advanced features that many users (often spoiled by overly simple GUI interfaces) are unaware of.</p><p>Attendees will take away a better understanding of how git works, and the specific steps they can do to solve their problems or issues that they may come across while working with git in the future.</p>
