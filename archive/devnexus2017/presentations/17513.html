				<p>Functional programming has gained the recognition it deserves and almost all mainstream languages now support functional style of programming. With the introduction of lambdas in Java 8, we have new tools on our hands. In this presentation, we explore this tool and how we can benefit from it.</p><p>We start with an introduction to lambda and learn about imperative vs. declarative style and learn how to solve some common problems with it.</p>
