				<p>This presentation is designed to help you use your Java programming skills to create hobby projects using the Raspberry Pi as an inexpensive (35 USD) interface to the physical world. We will teach the concepts by demonstrating examples with working projects and source code. Some of the topics we will cover include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unboxing your Raspberry Pi and setting up Java</li>
  <li>Using Pi4J</li>
  <li>Programming common I2C devices</li>
  <li>Creating visual and touch UIs</li>
  <li>3D Printing custom hardware</li>
  <li>Using Java 9 modules to shrink your app size</li>
</ul><p>Coming out of this session you will have the knowledge you need to start building your own embedded projects for your home or office, and can leverage your Java programming skills to connect it to the Internet of Things. Start building the future now with Java 9 Embedded technology!</p>
