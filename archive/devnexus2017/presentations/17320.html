				<p>Well written microservices obey the laws of domain driven design, one of which is finding a ubiquitous language to describe their abstractions accurately.</p><p>Functional and reactive APIs provide the best language for building event-driven microservices that operate over continuous streams of events or data, whether for data movement, analytics, ES/CQRS or more traditional enterprise integration. </p><p>We will explore with live coding examples the newly added reactive programming support in Spring Cloud Stream, based on the same foundation as Spring 5: Project Reactor. We will see how it complements and enriches the ability to write event-driven microservices that can transparently implement high-level primitives such as consumer groups and partitioning with messaging systems such as RabbitMQ, Kafka or Google PubSub, and how to integrate with other layers, such as Spring Reactive Web. We will also show how to use Reactive Streams clients, such as Reactive Kafka for building end to end reactive applications.</p><p>Finally, we will show you how to chain the microservices in complex pipelines that can be seamlessly deployed on Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes or Mesos, using Spring Cloud Data Flow.</p>
