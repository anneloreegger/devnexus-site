				<p>This session focuses on what is data and how data is used to inform the design process for new products, features, and the overall user experience. There is a lot of buzz around data; however, having lots of data alone is not useful. As developers, we play an important role in how data is captured / extracted / obtained, how data is analyzed and merged across multiple data sources, and how the findings are applied to improve designs. </p>

					<p>I have 15+ years of experience as a business analyst, developer, technical lead, and designer. I am currently an Application Architect / Manager at Daugherty Business Solutions, where we make “magic” happen at Fortune 1000 companies in the Atlanta area. I recently finished my Masters in Human Computer Interaction from Georgia Institute of Technology, where I spent time playing with Arduino, Raspberry Pis, and fun environment sensors. My Masters Project focused on gleaning vibe of a neighborhood from geotagged tweets from the Atlanta area. </p>
