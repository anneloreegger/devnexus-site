				<p>Format: Lecture with Demos<br/>Prerequisite: Base Mobile app development needed only</p><p>This session will provide a step-by-step approach to add a number of scalable mobile cloud services to build a modern native Android client app. Learn about how to develop mobile apps which use a number of cross-platform mobile cloud services directly with minimal code. In session will be walking through a demos building a Android mobile app leveraging one of the cloud providers, AWS, to show how to configure and add components to your mobile cloud architecture, and then leverage these components as a part of your mobile client development. To do this we will review the backend cloud services for user identity management &amp; data sync, cloud storage &amp; dynamic content updates, and a fully-managed NoSQL database. We will also discuss the best practices for building a highly scalable backend so you can add your own functionality as needed for your application dynamically. Join the session and discover cloud services for mobile platforms while learning the best practices on building a powerful cloud-ready/native Android apps that allow you to reach the broadest set of users and scale globally.</p>
