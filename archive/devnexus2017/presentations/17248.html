				<div class="presentation-body">
					<p>Greg Bulmash once wrote a joke that went so viral it became an urban legend, and it still circulates nearly 20 years later. He started in tech by publishing jokes and humorous essays to his own web site, eventually rising to become Senior Editor of the Internet Movie Database (IMDb.com). In 2005, he dusted off his BASIC programming skills from the 80s, taught himself some of the programming languages that power the web, and pivoted into a career writing code and communicating with developer audiences. He currently works as a Technical Evangelist for Login with Amazon and in his spare time runs Seattle CoderDojo, a volunteer group where local tech professionals help kids learn computer programming.</p><p>He&rsquo;s spoken at OSCON, CascadiaJS, DevNexus, Apps World North America, and multiple meetups about web development, programming, and teaching kids how to code.</p>
