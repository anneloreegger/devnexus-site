				<p>The process of defining the scope for Java EE 8 was the most community opinion driven in the history of the platform. Java EE 8 is supposed to solidly enable HTTP/2, Server-Sent Events (SSE), JSON and aligning all parts of the platform with Java SE 8. It includes a much awaited security API overhaul, a brand new MVC API as well as a slew of critical updates to APIs like JSF, JMS, JPA, JAX-RS and CDI. Unfortunately the road to Java EE 8 has not been very smooth. After a long and silent delay Oracle has now announced updated plans for Java EE 8 and Java EE 9. The plans include adding support for dynamic configuration, health-checks, NoSQL, fat-jars, eventual consistency, multi-tenancy, dynamic discovery and circuit breakers. </p><p>This session will explain the situation including the details of what is proposed for Java EE 8 and Java EE 9. The talk will end with what all us need to do about it now. We will also discuss the critical role Java EE and it&rsquo;s APIs play in maintaining the health of the entire Java ecosystem.</p>
