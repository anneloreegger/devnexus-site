				<p>This talk will go through various common machine learning algorithms and their inner workings. There are no libraries here. This is a very deep dive into the math and processes that underpin the common algorithms we see today. The algorithms we will dive into are Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and Neural Networks. Understanding the inner workings of these algorithms will allow you to squeeze every ounce of performance and accuracy out of them. Be prepared as we will cover very advanced topics such as algorithm vectorization, high order polynomials, one hot encoding and more. This is an ambitious talk for this time line and we may or may not make it through all 3 algorithms.</p>
