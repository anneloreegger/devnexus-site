				<p>One of the biggest features of Java 8 was the incorporation of Functional Programming (Lambda Expressions). Many questions began to turn around Android development, like when we will can use Lambda Expressions?<br/>One interesting fact to stand out is that Android applications are not Java ones, we only use all the syntax and power of Java for create Android applications, in deed Google use a version created for Apache call Apache Harmony.<br/>In the Google I/O 2016 they launch a new compiler call &ldquo;The Jack toolchain&rdquo;, this compiler allows us to incorporate Lambda Expressions in our Android Code, which is subsequently transformed to the .dex files that run on Android system.<br/>In this talk we will explore the work of Functional Programming and Lambda Expressions and how we can incorporate this powerful way to code on Android using the Jack toolchain.</p>
