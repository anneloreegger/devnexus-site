				<p>One of the big new features in JDK 8, as we all know, was Lambda expressions. This gave us a much simpler way to represent an anonymous function without all the boilerplate code of inner classes.</p><p>The origins of Lambda expressions go back eighty years, well before Java (and even modern computing) started and is based on the work of Alonso Church, who created Lambda calculus as a mathematical model of computation.</p><p>In this session, we’ll explore how using only one new functional interface and a small library to display results in a more readable form we can solve (in theory) any problem using only Lambda expressions. This really is Java, but most of it won’t look like any code you’ve ever seen before. Be prepared for some mind-bending use of Lambda expressions!</p>
