				<p>Microservices-based architectures are en-vogue. The last couple of<br/>years we have learned how the thought-leaders implement them, and<br/>every other week we have heard about how containers and<br/>Platform-as-a-Service offerings make them ultimately happen.</p><p>The problem is that the developers are almost forgotten and left alone<br/>with provisioning and continuous delivery systems, containers and<br/>resource schedulers, and frameworks and patterns to help slice<br/>existing monoliths. How can we get back in control and efficiently<br/>develop them without having to provision complete production-like<br/>environments locally, by hand?</p><p>All the new buzzwords, frameworks and hyped tools have made us forget<br/>ourselves—Java developers–and what it means to be productive and have<br/>fun building systems. The problem that we set out to solve is: how can<br/>we run real-world Microservices-based systems on our local development<br/>machines, managing provisioning and orchestration of potentially<br/>hundreds of services directly from a single command line tool, without<br/>sacrificing productivity enablers like hot code reloading and instant<br/>turnaround time?</p><p>During this talk you&rsquo;ll experience first hand how much fun it can be<br/>to develop large-scale Microservices-based systems. You will learn a<br/>lot about what it takes to fail fast and recover and truly understand<br/>the power of a fully integrated Microservices development environment.</p>

					<p>Markus Eisele is a Java Champion, former Java EE Expert Group member, Java community leader of German DOAG, founder of JavaLand, reputed speaker at Java conferences around the world, and a very well known figure in the Enterprise Java world. He works for Lightbend.<br/>You’ve known and seen him at different conferences and Java User Groups meetups or read his blogs or are following his social media presence. While talking about middleware for many years you’ll continue to hear him talk about enterprise grade Java going forward. Focussed on education about the latest trends in building enterprise systems in a reactive way with Java.<br/>He’s been looking into containers and microservices architectures more deeply and also wrote a book about modern Java EE Design Patterns with O’Reily. He is excited to educate more about how microservices architectures can integrate and complement existing platforms, and will also talk about how to successfully build resilient applications with Java.</p>
