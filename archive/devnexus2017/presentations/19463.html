				<p>In the past, IT has often been seen a necessary evil that the business has had to deal with on the road to getting things done. Engineers get stuck spending their time toiling with legacy infrastructure and tech stacks instead of using their talents to build new software solutions that impact the business. At Chick-fil-A, we have seen that trend change. Instead of being a necessary evil, IT is engaging with and transforming the business. How did it happen? In this session, we will discuss how Chick-fil-A is embracing cloud platform services and serverless technologies, microservices architectures, and DevOps teams to create an agile IT experience. Instead of sluggish responsiveness, we are now able to quickly deliver exciting new capabilities (like IoT, Data Lakes for Analytics) to our business. We will dive into the technical details and architecture patterns weâ€™ve used and share some key lessons learned to help you on your journey.</p>
