				<p>When <em>the cloud</em> became a development watchword, several players immediately moved in to occupy the space. And then a few more, and then a few more, and then&hellip;. Well, pardon the pun, but the clouds burst open, and everybody suddenly seems to have a cloud offering these days. Going by various different names (like Infrastructure-as-a-Service or Backend-as-a-Service or Platform-as-a-Service or&hellip;) and offering different options, it&rsquo;s hard to figure out which of these are interesting and which are yesterday&rsquo;s news and which are too futuristic to be of use today. In this presentation, we&rsquo;ll take a look at the clouds, read them like a weatherman, understand which are useful and why, and get a better look at a few as a concrete example. Amazon Web Services, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform are three of the big ones, but there&rsquo;s a few more players out there that might surprise you and get you to stand up and take notice.</p>
