			<div class="biography-body">
				<p>One of the biggest jumps for developers productivity in Java 8 was the introduction of functional programming with lambda expressions and streams, being one of the most disruptive changes in decades.</p><p>Functional programing and consequently reactive programming are starting to gain traction, impacting software libraries, middleware stacks, and software arquitectures. Hence an imperative topic to catch up.</p><p>In this breakout we will explore basic concepts of functional programing and its orthogonal relation with object oriented programming, later we will discuss and try top-notch libraries that are being used in the industry, like Eclipse Collections, jOOQ/jOOL, JavaSlang and finally using these concepts in Vert.x microservices.</p>
