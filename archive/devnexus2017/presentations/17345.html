				<p>Web developers can build apps for iOS, Android, and Windows based on the same frameworks they use for the Web by using a shared codebase. However, the methods for improving mobile app performance can be different from those web developers use for web apps. Doris Chen outlines what impacts “native performance” and explains how the startup time, as well as the overhead of resume, memory, communication, and the Web, can all contribute to the performance of Cordova apps and mobile web. To build cross platform mobile app that perform well, it’s important to understand how to avoid common pitfalls and how to use the technologies in the most efficient ways. Doris introduces tools for performance tests and demonstrates how to measure mobile app performance by using diagnostic tools for different platforms. Doris also shares practical tips for building faster Cordova and Mobile apps by exploring Document Object Model (DOM) complexity, animation techniques, and memory management.</p>
