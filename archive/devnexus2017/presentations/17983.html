				<p>Simple demo apps are nice and sugary sweet and a great way to be exposed to new technology. But playing around with tutorials does not mean you’ll be successful at creating a large-scale project using it. Large-scale business apps require robust and well-designed architecture to handle future growth of features and maintenance.</p><p>In this talk we’ll discuss the benefits of building your project using a FSM (Finite State Machine) with State pattern. We’ll dive in and use these to design a real-world home security system, and analyze the problem domain for proper gathering of technical requirements. FSM is not the solution for everything, but when applied to the right problem it will set a solid foundation for your software to live a very long and comfortable life.</p>
