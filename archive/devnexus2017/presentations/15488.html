				<p>As the world moves towards Containers, DevOps and Microservices, application deployment to the cloud ought to become a lot simpler. The Microservices architecture which is the basis of many new age distributed systems such as OpenStack, NetFlix and so on is at the heart of Cloud Foundry - a complete developer-oriented Platform as a Service (PaaS) that is IaaS agnostic and supports vSphere, OpenStack, Google, Azure and AWS&hellip;. pretty much all of them.</p><p>We will discuss the Microservices architecture, 12-factor app, containers, etc. and how to architect applications for the cloud in general and Cloud Foundry in particular. Data Services on the other hand is very sticky and a lift and shift approach does not work well. We will be walking through a Java app and how to scale, monitor, and consolidate logs, etc.</p><p>Attend this hands-on session in which we will cover the basics of Cloud Foundry and walk through some monolithic applications and how they can use a microservices approach. We will then look at Dockerizing the app. And compare and contrast the approaches. We will cover many of the Non Functional Requirements(NFR), which is typically in the domain of the architect such as scaling, security and HA and how applications can leverage Pivotal Web Services for these.</p><p>We will leverage material primarily from existing material and update it for delivery.</p>
