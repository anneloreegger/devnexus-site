				<p><a href="https://webpack.github.io/">Webpack</a> has been a popular module bundler and has taken over grunt and gulp as the default build tool for packing front-end assets. There is a good reason for that: it simplifies many of the tasks that you normally have to do when creating a front-end setup, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bundling all JS files into one bundle</li>
  <li>Minifying, uglifying the JS and CSS</li>
  <li>Transpiling between source languages: TS =&gt; JS, ES2015+ =&gt; JS, SCSS =&gt; JS, etc</li>
  <li>Live reloading browser after changes to source files</li>
  <li>Shimming, aliasing global variables</li>
  <li>Creating different configurations for dev/prod/test</li>
  <li>and so on&hellip;</li>
</ul><p>In this talk we will cover the basics of Webpack and do some simple configuration to setup a React/Angular project. We will look at the various plugins and loaders that makeup a standard configuration. By the end of this talk, you will have the confidence to do your own <strong>front-end</strong> build setups!</p>
