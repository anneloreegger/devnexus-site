In this talk we&rsquo;ll cover those libraries that have risen to the top by proving themselves to be worthy of a place in every developer&rsquo;s toolbox, both for production and testing code. We&rsquo;ll also cover some fairly new libraries that are bound to make a big impact in the ecosystem.</p>
