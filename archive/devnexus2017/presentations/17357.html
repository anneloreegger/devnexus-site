				<p>When the word &ldquo;microservice&rdquo; comes up, many thoughts go directly to REST endpoints powering websites. However, applying the 12 factor concepts to batch and integration style workloads can provide immense benefits. In this talk, we will walk through creating data microservices for both streaming applications (integration) via Spring Cloud Stream as well as short lived microservices via Spring Cloud Task. We&rsquo;ll finish by looking at how Spring Cloud DataFlow can be used to orchestrate these microservices into useful applications. A general knowledge of Spring and Spring Boot will be useful for this talk.</p>
