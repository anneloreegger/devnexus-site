			<div class="biography-body">
				<p>Reactive Programming is receiving quite a bit of attention and for good reasons. It’s a nice logic next step from functional programming. It takes the concept of function composition and lazy evaluations to the next level. It streamlines handling of many critical issues that are architectural in nature: resilience, scale, responsiveness, and messaging.</p><p>In this workshop, we will start with a quick introduction to reactive programming. We will then dive into code examples and learn how to create reactive applications. We’ll learn to implement observables, to deal with errors in a graceful manner, learn both synchronous and asynchronous solutions, hot vs. cold observables, and dealing with backpressures.</p>
