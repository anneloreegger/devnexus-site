				<p>The Cloud is the perfect extension for mobile applications. Mobile apps don’t exist in a vacuum, you never know if you’ll have 10 or 10,000 users, and sooner or later you’ll need to save user data in the cloud, perform operations server-side for enhanced scalability, or monitor data feeds to push notifications to your mobile users. Microsoft Azure provides the best infrastructure for mobile developers across all platforms thanks to cross-platform storage, authentication and push notification services, all residing in the cloud. This session explores how you can build cloud-enabled cross-platform applications for iOS, Android and Windows 10 using native SDKs and Microsoft Azure Mobile App Services. You’ll learn how to quickly spin-up a Node.js backend in Azure App Services to authenticate users via Microsoft, Google, Facebook or Twitter credentials, store data remotely in NoSQL tables and blob storage, and even how to send push notifications to all vendor platforms, all through live cross-platform demos. Whether you’re a weekend warrior building consumer apps or a corporate mobile developer building apps for the enterprise, the cloud is the perfect companion for your mobile apps. Come learn how easy it is to harness its power.</p>
