				<p>CSS has changed. It&rsquo;s moving away from the mired mess of it&rsquo;s origin and toward a bright future of interesting layout and easy design.</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve been focused on other important skills in the past 3 years, you&rsquo;ve missed out on a lot of new, helpful techniques.</p><p>This workshop will cover the history of CSS (much like the breakout I&rsquo;m proposing, as well) and then will go into a deep dive into Flexbox, CSS Grid, CSS shapes, Sass, etc. with practical examples and tutorials of each.</p><p>This workshop is targeted toward developers who have grown dependent on Bootstrap and Foundation for their CSS knowledge. It&rsquo;s time to come back into the fold and reclaim the third leg of the basic Web tripod!</p>
