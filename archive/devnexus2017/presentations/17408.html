				<p>This session covers the three technologies of Java EE 8 that have<br/>something to do with HTTP: Servlet, JAX-RS, and JSF.</p><p>For many years, Servlet technology has been at the heart of Java EE and<br/>Enterprise Java. Over that same timespan, technologies associated with<br/>the cloud, such as containerization, microservices, REST, pay-per-use<br/>computing and continuous delivery have beceome more relevant.<br/>Enterprises have shifted from using application servers and their<br/>associated deployment artifacts to newer models that take advantage of<br/>the strengths of the cloud. What kind of role can old reliable Servlets<br/>play in this new world?</p><p>The current practice of cloud development in Java is founded on REST and<br/>asynchrony. For many developers, that means the standard JAX-RS<br/>specification and also its reference implementation, Jersey. The JAX-RS<br/>portion of this session will cover suggested enhancements coming to next<br/>version of JAX-RS including server-sent events, nonblocking IO, reactive<br/>programming and more complete CDI integration.</p><p>Rounding out the session, we&rsquo;ll take a quick look at what&rsquo;s new in JSF.</p>
