				<p>Itâ€™s no secret that developers crave working with packaged, re-usable bits of functionality. Whether it&rsquo;s a class, library, or user interface component, the value proposition is similar: you can focus on the core aspects of your application without reinventing the wheel. JavaServer Faces (JSF) provides a battle-tested user interface component model that runs on the server but renders to a client (which is almost always a web browser). Over time, however, web browsers have become much more capable, especially with HTML5. One emerging part of HTML5 is Web Components, which provides a client-side user interface component model that runs entirely in the browser.</p><p>So, what does this mean for server-side component frameworks like JSF? Is there any synergy with Web Components? Can they be used together? In this session, we examine how each component model works, how they differ, what they have in common, and how they can work together.</p>
