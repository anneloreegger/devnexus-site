				<p>TypeScript has seen enormous growth over the past year. Across the board developers are falling in love with TypeScript as they find it to be the most productive way to work with JavaScript. With TypeScript 2.0, it only gets better. In this session, we will show how adding TypeScript to existing JavaScript projects is easier than ever. We will dive into the biggest features of the 2.0 release such as non-nullable types, read-only modifiers, and down-level async/await. Finally, we will talk about the future of TypeScript and what you can expect in the coming months. <br/> </p>
