				<p>LiftWeb is an interesting Scala web framework which has been around for a few years. Coming into this session with a general knowledge of Scala as a language, we&rsquo;ll delve directly into the framework and start looking at how to work in the framework. We will focus on some of the really interesting points that make LiftWeb one of my go-to Scala web frameworks:<br/>* XSS mitigations<br/>* CSRF mitigations<br/>* Mapper ORM<br/>* View first<br/>* Node Sequences instead of Strings<br/>By the end of this session, you should be able to create a LiftWeb project from scratch and should be comfortable walking into a LiftWeb project and adding/removing views.</p>
