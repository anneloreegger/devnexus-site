				<p>As in a good Greek Tragedy, scaling devops to big teams has 3 stages and usually end badly. In this play (it’s more than a talk!) we’ll present you with Pentagon Inc, and their way to scaling devops from a team of 3 engineers to a team of 100 (spoiler – it’s painful!)</p><p>In this talk we will look at the resources, techniques and tools needed for managing DevOps at Scale and we will discuss the challenges that companies encounter when they hit it.</p>
