				<p>Everybody know Hibernate right? Perhaps don’t. JPA is so popular these days that many people think that Hibernate is just a JPA implementation. Wrong! Hibernate is a very powerful tool and is constantly innovating. Have you checked Hibernate recently? There are a lot of new features that you probably don’t know, but you should!</p><p>Join us on this session to see which are the new features provided on Hibernate 5 that you didn’t know, including: new Bootstrap API, Java 8 support, Generics and AutoCloseable, Bytecode Enhancement for lazy fields and collections. And wouldn&rsquo;t be great if we could integrate ElasticSearch with Hibernate so that all changes are in sync? And what about using your domain objects in ElasticSearch queries? We got it all covered!</p>
