				<p>As we architect our systems for greater demands, scale, uptime, and performance, the hardest thing to control becomes the environment in which we deploy and the subtle but crucial interactions between complicated systems. And microservices obviously are the way to go forward with those complicated systems. But what makes it so hard to build them? And why should you embrace failure instead of doing what we can do best: Preventing failure. This talk introduces you to the problem domain of a distributed system which consists of a couple of microservices. It shows how to build, deploy and orchestrate the chaos and introduces you to a couple of pattern to prevent and compensate failure.</p>

					<p>Markus Eisele is a Java Champion, former Java EE Expert Group member, Java community leader of German DOAG, founder of JavaLand, reputed speaker at Java conferences around the world, and a very well known figure in the Enterprise Java world. He works for Lightbend.<br/>You’ve known and seen him at different conferences and Java User Groups meetups or read his blogs or are following his social media presence. While talking about middleware for many years you’ll continue to hear him talk about enterprise grade Java going forward. Focussed on education about the latest trends in building enterprise systems in a reactive way with Java.<br/>He’s been looking into containers and microservices architectures more deeply and also wrote a book about modern Java EE Design Patterns with O’Reily. He is excited to educate more about how microservices architectures can integrate and complement existing platforms, and will also talk about how to successfully build resilient applications with Java.</p>
