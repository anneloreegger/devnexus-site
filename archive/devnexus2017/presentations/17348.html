				<p>A private Java (Maven or Gradle) repository as a service can be setup in the cloud. A private Docker registry as a service can be easily setup in the cloud. But what if you want to build a holistic CI/CD pipeline, and on the cloud of YOUR choice? </p><p>In this talk Baruch will take you through steps of setting up a universal artifact repository, which can serve for both Java and Docker. You&rsquo;ll learn how to build a CI/CD pipeline with traceable metadata from the Java source files all the way to Docker images. Amazon, Azure, and Google Cloud (do you have setup that works on these?) will be used as an example although the recipes shown would be applicable to other cloud as well.</p>
