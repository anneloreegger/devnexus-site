			<div class="biography-body">
				<p>A cloud based, microservice or IoT architecture requires architects and developers to rethink authentication and authorization. It is not feasible to have everyone log in separately for different systems, using a different username and password for each. The goal is to have a single identity that can be authenticated once.</p><p>A common approach is to use some sort of single sign-on (SSO) solution. SAML and OpenID Connect both provide capabilities in this area that can be leveraged for the cloud as well as IoT.</p><p>This talk will provide you with all you need to reach this goal in all your Java based applications.</p>
