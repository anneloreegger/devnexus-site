				<p>App Service is a cloud platform that enables building powerful web and mobile apps that connect to data anywhere, in the cloud or on-premises. This session will focus on web development featuring App Service technologies such as Web Apps, API Apps, Logic Apps, and more. Web Apps allow for creation and deployment of scalable web apps in many languages including .NET and Node.js. API Apps support quick building and consumption of APIs. Logic apps can connect apps, data, and devices to connectors such as Office 365, Twitter, and Slack. Demos will be provided to show how all of these and more operate or interact with each other and sample some IoT projects that use App Service, plus showcase the convenience of using Visual Studio App Service Tools. </p>
