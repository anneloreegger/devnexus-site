				<p>Domain-Driven Design (DDD) promises to simplify enterprise application development and is gradually gaining traction as an alternative to traditional four-tier architectures originally popularized by J2EE. As the name implies, DDD is an architectural approach that strongly focuses on materializing the business domain in software. </p><p>This session demonstrates first-hand how DDD can be implemented using Java EE via a project named Cargo Tracker. Part of the Java EE Blue Prints, Cargo Tracker seamlessly maps concepts like bounded contexts, layered architectures, entities, value objects, aggregates, services, repositories and factories to realistic code examples. The Cargo Tracker project also embraces popular practices adopted by the DDD community such as Object Oriented Analysis, Domain Models, Test Driven Development, Agile Refactoring, Continuous Integration, Object Relational Mapping, Dependency Injection and Cross-Cutting Concerns, incorporating these concepts into a realistic Java EE application.</p>
