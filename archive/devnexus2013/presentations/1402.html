				<p>Remote pair programming is surprisingly simple and inexpensive to implement, but it’s not just about bleeding-edge technology — a good attitude is just as important as good technology. Joe will walk you through how your distributed team can successfully implement remote pair programming, allowing you to realize the same benefits as in-person pairing and address some of the challenges of distributed development. Joe will discuss the important personal and interpersonal skills needed for remote pairing as well as the technology.</p><p>Distributed agile teams need not forgo the valuable discipline of pair programming. Thanks to ubiquitous high speed internet service, major advances in online collaboration technologies, and the need to source talent wherever they might be, remote pair programming is becoming more common.</p><p><em>Audience</em>: All members of software development teams who are interested in pair programming and distributed agile will benefit from this session. Developers will learn the nuts-and-bolts of remote pairing, product managers, business experts, etc. will learn how to integrate remote pairing developers seamlessly with the team. Attendees are invited to share their own remote collaboration experiences — good and bad.</p>
