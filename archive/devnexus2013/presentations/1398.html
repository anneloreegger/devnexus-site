				<p>The majority of applications built on Java Platform in the past decade have been single-threaded. And the easiest way to address performance issues was to add a faster CPU. However, that option is no longer viable as the hardware industry has shifted from single-core processors to multi-core processors. Traditional concurrent development on the Java Platform requires in depth knowledge of threads, locks, and queues (oh, my!). Fortunately, new languages and frameworks that run on the Java Platform, such as Akka, have made concurrent programming easier.</p><p>In this session, I will demonstrate several concurrent processing techniques including Fire and Forget, Fork-Join, and Asynchronous Web Services using the Java Concurrency Library, the Akka Framework and Jersey (JAX-RS).</p><p>Source Code: <a href="https://github.com/jtdeane">https://github.com/jtdeane</a></p>
