				<p>So you think you&rsquo;ve picked up enough JavaScript to be dangerous, but feel like the whole prototypical language thing is still a mystery. In this session, we&rsquo;ll go from basic JavaScript to advanced JavaScript. We&rsquo;ll discuss and code modular JavaScript with CommonJS. We&rsquo;ll look into the details of a prototype language and discuss things like parasitic inheritance. We&rsquo;ll also look at JavaScript libraries that will help you get the most out of JavaScript - not jQuery, but a library like UnderscoreJS and SugarJS.</p>
