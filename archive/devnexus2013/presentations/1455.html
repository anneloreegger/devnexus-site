				<p>With the increasing popularity of Functional Programming (FP) it is easy to get caught up in the theory, syntax, and language features and forget about why FP is so useful. In this talk we will be looking at common coding problems and discover how FP provides solutions that are simpler, more efficient, and more flexible than those offered by imperative programming techniques. Each solution will introduce a FP feature or approach that is either commonly overlooked or not easily expressed in imperative languages.</p>
