				<p>Cloud computing isn&rsquo;t just about application deployment. There are also a growing number of cloud-based web services that you can use to develop your application. One of the most well known is Amazon&rsquo;s Simple Storage Service. But there are many others including web services for messaging, relational and NoSQL databases, email and telephony. Using these services allows you to build highly scalable applications without the pain and cost of having to develop and operate your own infrastructure. </p><p>In this presentation, you will learn about the benefits and drawbacks of these Web services; their typical use cases and how to use them. We will describe a location aware, telephony application that is built using cloud services. You will learn about strategies for building resilient, fault tolerant applications that consume cloud services.</p>
