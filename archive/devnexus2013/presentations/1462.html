				<p>HTML5 is still a relatively new technology, but it&rsquo;s rapidly maturing. One thing that HTML5 is currently missing is a way to easily build components, such as sliders or image viewers, for example, that you can drop into a webpage or web application.</p><p>In this talk you will see how to create your own ad-hoc components with today&rsquo;s technology, and you&rsquo;ll learn about an initiative underway to define a bona-fide component system for HTML5 so that you can implement your own components.</p>
