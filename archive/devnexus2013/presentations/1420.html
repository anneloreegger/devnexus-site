				<p>Have you ever wished that your local development sandbox could look exactly like production, but you&rsquo;ve got a mismatch between your local OS and your production OS? And what about the age old &ldquo;it works on my machine&rdquo; excuse that quite often stems from differences between developer sandboxes? Many have turned to virtualization, creating a machine image that can be passed around the team. But who manages the template? How do you keep things in sync?</p><p>In this session, we&rsquo;ll explore Vagrant (<a href="http://www.vagrantup.com)/">http://www.vagrantup.com)</a>, an open source tool that allows you to easily create and manage virtual development environments that can be provisioned on demand and &ldquo;thrown away&rdquo; when no longer needed.</p><p>Our agenda will include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating new base OS templates using the Vagrant Veewee plugin</li>
  <li>Creating a new development box using Vagrant</li>
  <li>Provisioning the box using Puppet</li>
  <li>Provisioning the box using Chef</li>
  <li>Deploying a simple web application to a multi-box development environment</li>
  <li>Packaging and distributing the box within your team</li>
</ul>
