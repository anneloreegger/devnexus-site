				<p>MongoDB has been designed for versatility, but the techniques you might use to build, say, an analytics engine or a hierarchical data store might not be obvious. In this talk, we&rsquo;ll learn about MongoDB in practice by looking at four hypothetical application designs (based on real-world designs, of course). Topics to be covered include schema design, indexing, transactions (gasp!), trees, what&rsquo;s fast, and what&rsquo;s not. Sprinkled with tips, tricks, shoots, ladders, and trap doors, you&rsquo;re guaranteed to learn something new in this interdisciplinary talk.</p>
