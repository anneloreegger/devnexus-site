				<p>This session explores how NoSQL solutions like MongoDB, Cassandra, Neo4j, HBase and CouchDB can be used with JPA and Java EE. Although the primary focus is on EclipseLink NoSQL, we will also cover Hibernate OGM, EasyCassandra, Morphia, etc as well as seeing how NoSQL can be used natively via basic CDI injection without JPA. As part of the talk, we will briefly discuss the changes in JPA 2.1, the latest JPA revision slated for inclusion into Java EE 7.</p><p><strong>Source Code</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/m-reza-rahman/jpa-nosql-demo">https://github.com/m-reza-rahman/jpa-nosql-demo</a></p>
