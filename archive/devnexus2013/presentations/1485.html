				<p>Many developers&rsquo; experience with <a href="http://www.springsource.org/">Spring</a> began with JDBC-based data access, and while the template design pattern remains prevalent, Spring&rsquo;s suite of data libraries has continued to evolve (over the past decade!) with the increased popularity of NoSQL data stores. Spring has also evolved to support higher-level patterns, such as ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) and EIP (Enterprise Integration Patterns), with <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-batch">Spring Batch</a> and <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-integration">Spring Integration</a>, respectively. Taken together <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-data">Spring Data</a>, Batch and Integration provide a comprehensive foundation for working with data and building message-driven applications. In this session, we&rsquo;ll walk through the libraries and frameworks with an emphasis on introductory demos.</p>
