				<p>What can the life &amp; methods of the celebrated physicist, Richard Feynman, teach us about software development? In this keynote, we will explore the idea that many of the characteristics of Feynman&rsquo;s approach to physics are applicable to us as programmers and we&rsquo;ll dream of a world where developers are free to follow the beat of a different drum.</p>
