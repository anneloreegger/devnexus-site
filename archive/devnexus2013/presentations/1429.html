				<p>Android&rsquo;s bundled SQLite database is powerful, but requires a lot of hand-coded SQL to get started. Using an ORM can simplify database development for many applications, and the Android ecosystem already has several to choose from. stORM is a lightweight DAO generator written by Android Developer Advocate David Chandler that aims for a streamlined developer experience (only two annotations required) and solid performance (preferring code generation over reflection). stORM is extensible, minimally intrusive, and offers built-in CSV backup / restore capabilities to facilitate database version upgrades. Along with stORM, Chandler will present basic-http-client, a lightweight Java HTTP client with a built-in asynchronous interface.</p>

Prior to joining Google, Chandler worked on Internet banking applications with Intuit and launched a non-profit startup built with GWT and AppEngine.
