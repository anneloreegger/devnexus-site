				<p>Scala is an expressive language, but can be hard to grasp when coming from imperative languages. The key is understanding what expression is in Scala, and how to adapt code to be more expressive. This talk covers the &lsquo;zen&rsquo; of Scala development, as well as what changes the new features in Scala 2.10 bring. In particular, the topics covered are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Expression oriented programming and basic functional programming</li>
  <li>Simplicity in Design</li>
  <li>Enhancing libraries with Implicit classes and value classes</li>
  <li>Asynchronous programming with Futures and Promises</li>
  <li>Dynamic types for DSLs</li>
  <li>Reflection as a platform to write macros</li>
  <li>Macros and Rainbow Explosion Powers</li>
</ul>
