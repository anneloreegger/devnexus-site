				<p>It&rsquo;s an uncomfortable feeling: you read a news article describing clandestine organization cells, distributed networks of small teams which are nearly completely unaffected by each other&rsquo;s operations yet united in their goals and beliefs. Their flat hierarchies mean the loss of one team member, even a leader, has little effect on the cell. The organization&rsquo;s recruiting techniques focus on identifying disenfranchised yet influential individuals, sympathetic to the cell&rsquo;s cause, and incorporating them into the group after a thorough vetting process.</p><p>After reading this you say to yourself, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I work, and it&rsquo;s awesome.&rdquo;</p><p>Learn how running a 200-person (and growing) Agile/XP software consulting company is much like running a clandestine organization, and how your teams can take techniques often associated with negative actions and use them for the good of your projects.</p>
