				<p>Many iOS applications require the use of external data in order to display current information. For example, a weather application would be useless without having recent forecast information to display to the user. These types of apps typically make HTTP requests for data from online services, which often implement a REST based API. In this session we will discuss some of the concepts behind designing a REST based API, then illustrate an implementation using Spring MVC&rsquo;s powerful REST support. On the client side, we&rsquo;ll utilize Apple&rsquo;s iOS SDK to demonstrate how to make RESTful requests and consume data for presentation to the user.</p>
