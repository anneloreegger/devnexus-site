				<p>Even with the recent explosion in alternative languages for the JVM, the vast majority of us are still writing code in &ldquo;Java the language&rdquo; in order to put bread on the table. Proper craftsmanship demands that we write the best Java code that we can possibly write. Fortunately we have a guide in Joshua Bloch&rsquo;s Effective Java.</p><p>In his foreword to the first edition, Guy Steele writes about the importance of learning three aspects of any language: grammar, vocabulary, and idioms. Unfortunately many programmers stop learning after mastering the first two. Effective Java is your guide to understanding idiomatic Java programming.</p><p>Effective Java is organized into 78 standalone &ldquo;items,&rdquo; all of which will be impossible to cover in one session. Instead I&rsquo;ve chosen a subset of the most important techniques and practices that are commonly missed by today&rsquo;s Java programmers. You&rsquo;ll pick from a menu and decide where we&rsquo;ll head. Regardless of the path we take, you&rsquo;ll leave this session thoroughly equipped to write better Java code tomorrow!</p>
