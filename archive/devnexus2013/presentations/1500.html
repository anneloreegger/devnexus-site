				<p>Just as Big Data sources and distributed systems are more prevalent today; presenting results in meaningful ways is more cumbersome. BIRT – a set of developer tools co-developed and sponsored by Actuate as a top-level project within the Eclipse Foundation – can ease visualization of results in a user friendly way. BIRT provides native support to access Hadoop through Hive queries as well as connectors to other Big Data sources such as Cassandra and MongoDB.</p><p>Using BIRT, developers can display their internal or external clients’ data in a stylized tabular or graphical nature, and customize it using the BIRT Designer environment. These reports can include dynamic drill through and interactivity, and can be exported to various formats including PDF, HTML, XLS, and ODT.</p>
