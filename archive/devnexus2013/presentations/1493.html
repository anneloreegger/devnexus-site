				<p>Almost every example of an agile project involves a single team and while many successful projects are delivered that way, most enterprise software requires the interaction of several teams. But how do we scale agile beyond a single team? What practices translate and which ones don&rsquo;t? In this talk we&rsquo;ll discuss some of the issues you&rsquo;ll encounter as you move agile beyond a single group and how you can keep multiple stakeholders happy. While it isn&rsquo;t as simple as having a &ldquo;scrum of scrums&rdquo; it isn&rsquo;t as hard as replacing every line of COBOL.</p>
