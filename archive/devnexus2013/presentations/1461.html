				<p>Most 2D games have many things in common, such as scrolling backgrounds, animated characters, transitions between levels, and collision detection. HTML5 games have a couple added twists, namely integration with social networks and support for mobile devices.</p><p>This talk covers all those things and more. You&rsquo;ll see real-world implementations of 10 common aspects of 2D game development from scrolling backgrounds and sprites to time- and particle-systems.</p>
