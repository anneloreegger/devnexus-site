				<p>Creativity is an important aspect of successful software product development and IT projects. Creativity is subject to the mood of the team &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t exactly ooze from a team that is demoralized. But how do you motivate creative types? It seems that it&rsquo;s as easier to demotivate knowledge workers than it is to motivate them. Or is it? Programmers, testers, analysts and product managers can be motivated if you just take care. Know what motivates teams in general, find out what motivates each individual, be observant, and use a couple simple &ldquo;tools&rdquo;. This talk covers these concepts and includes thoughts from Jurgen Appelo&rsquo;s Management 3.0 and Dan Pink&rsquo;s Drive.</p>

					<p>Andrew Fuqua began developing software professionally in the mid &rsquo;80s using an iterative and incremental approach.

For the last few years, Andrew has been involved in agile transformations in larger organizations, which brings us to his current role as an Enterprise Agile Coach with LeadingAgile. Andrew has previously held positions in management, product management and software development at companies like Internet Security Systems, Allure Global, and IBM. </p><p>Andrew is the president of the Agile Atlanta user group, which he helped start in 2001, as well as the Atlanta Limited WIP Society.
