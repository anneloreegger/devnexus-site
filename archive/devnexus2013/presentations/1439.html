				<p>NoSQL databases such as Redis, MongoDB and Cassandra are emerging as a compelling choice for many applications. They can simplify the persistence of complex data models and offer significantly better scalability and performance. However, using a NoSQL database means giving up the benefits of the relational model such as SQL, constraints and ACID transactions. For some applications, the solution is polyglot persistence: using SQL and NoSQL databases together.</p><p>In this talk, you will learn about the benefits and drawbacks of polyglot persistence and how to design applications that use this approach. We will explore the architecture and implementation of an example application that uses MySQL as the system of record and Redis as a very high-performance database that handles queries from the front-end. You will learn about mechanisms for maintaining consistency across the various databases.</p>
