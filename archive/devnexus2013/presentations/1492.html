				<p>Despite what some developers think, we spend a lot more of our time reading code, code that was often written by someone that isn&rsquo;t around anymore. How do we deal with this common scenario without resorting to burning our predecessor in effigy? Better, how can we write code in such a way that our successors will heap effusive praise upon us at the mere mention of our name? During this talk, we&rsquo;ll read actual code discussing ways it could be improved. As we work through real examples, we&rsquo;ll explore the importance of patterns, principles like SOLID and SLAP and essential practices like unit testing and continuous integration.</p>
