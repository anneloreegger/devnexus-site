			<div class="biography-body">
				<p>Why is the relationship between the hippie counter culture of the 1960â€™s and the existence of spam email? How did a bunch of math geeks almost destroy the financial world? How can you build simpler architectures that scale? How are types of presentations like software designs? This keynote delves into these unexpected relationships and explores what they tell us about the intersection of the real world with software. Software is eating the world, and the geeks who write the code cook the buffet.</p>
