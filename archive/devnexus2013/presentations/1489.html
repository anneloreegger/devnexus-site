				<p>Storm is a distributed realtime computation system. Similar to how Hadoop provides a set of general primitives for doing batch processing, Storm provides a set of general primitives for doing realtime computation. Storm is simple, can be used with any programming language, and is a lot of fun to use! We will talk about how Storm is architected, how to interoperate with Hadoop, and a few real-world use-cases.</p>
