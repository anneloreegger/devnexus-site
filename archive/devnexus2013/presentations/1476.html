				<p>Erlang has made popular the notation of asynchronous message passing as means of distribution and Scaling. While the idea of &ldquo;actors&rdquo; is fundamentally simple, how do we, the software engineers, make use of this abstraction to develop real life, scalable systems? This talk designs a scalable distributed search service using Akka and Scala using the &ldquo;zen&rdquo; of Actor based design. It covers the basics of message passing, designing topologies and handling failure and moves onto a few common patterns in actors system design, including service overload detection and tracking user sessions.</p>
