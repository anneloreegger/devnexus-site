				<p>Big Data is quickly proving to be more than hype, as organizations face an increasing volume of information and the challenge to react to that information effectively. New tools and techniques are needed to address that challenge. However, <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-integration">Spring Integration</a> and <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-batch">Spring Batch</a> are both flexible enough to support these new tools and techniques upon their proven foundations for messaging and batch-processing.</p><p>In this session, we will walk through a couple Big Data use-cases implemented with Spring Integration, Spring Batch, and the <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-data/hadoop">Spring for Apache Hadoop</a> project. The underlying theme is that the frameworks can be combined to provide a platform for Big Data processing, both real-time and batch-oriented, while also incorporating new tools and techniques such as HDFS and Map Reduce.</p>
