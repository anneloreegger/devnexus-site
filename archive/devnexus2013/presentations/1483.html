				<p>Saying JavaScript is powerful is an understatement. The problem is it is way too powerful and dangerously flexible. Programmers often have trouble reaping its benefits due to its uncontrolled flexibility and, to a certain extent, lack of structure. One approach is to learn to tame the beast, like the authors of complex JavaScript libraries have done. Fortunately there is an alternative. CoffeeScript is JavaScript created in a humane way. In this session we will learn how, using CoffeeScript, we can reap all the benefits of JavaScript, but without losing our sanity in the process.</p>
