				<p>The purpose of this discussion is to show how to improve system-wide performance utilizing an EIP application using a distributed cache to share its data with or retrieve shared data from other applications in your framework. Due to the ever increasing amount of real time data and the need for real time analytics, alerting and reporting on this data, new patterns must be implemented to handle these requirements.<br/>In the past data has typically been shared between EIP applications via messaging or database which maybe too slow to meet SLA’s. In this discussion we will cover how to implement the following patterns/scenarios:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Cache-Aside via the detour EIP pattern to retrieve or insert data in the distributed cache.</li>
  <li>The “System of Record” pattern using EIP and distributed caching.</li>
  <li>The Write-Behind pattern to asynchronously update the database using distributed caching.</li>
</ul><p>An Ehcache gateway written using Spring Integration will demonstrate these patterns. In this discussion, a sample application will retrieve data from the FAA Airport Status Restful Service and share its information with other applications via a distributed cache. The ultimate goal of the presentation is to show developers that the data a EIP application processes can be shared real time with other applications in memory improving system wide performance.</p>
