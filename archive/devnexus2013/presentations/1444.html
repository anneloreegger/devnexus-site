				<p>You&rsquo;ve heard about this version control system called Git. Maybe some of your colleagues are using it. But is it here to stay, or just a fad?</p><p>We can best answer that by looking at what Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) like Git bring to the world of programming and authoring. There are a myriad of benefits ranging from the distributed nature of Git <em>without</em> a central point of failure, to its focus on working locally. These benefits are made possible by Git efficiently communicating over the network only when asked and its Unix-like compositional architecture.</p><p>We&rsquo;ll follow that up with a look at what GitHub, a web service focused on amplifying Git for easier collaboration, brings to this rapidly changing domain of software creation tools.</p><p>This talk will enable you to sling the basic Git and GitHub lingo around like an old hat when you get back to the office.</p>
