				<p>JavaFX Script is a compiled, declarative scripting language that runs on the desktop, in the web browser and on mobile devices. JavaFX includes a scene graph library and a unique scripting language that provides a declarative syntax for constructing sophisticated graphical user interfaces. Its graphics capabilities include support for animation, visual effects, gradients, and translucency. This jam-packed talk will detail JavaFX from cover to cover. This session will cover:</p>
<pre><code>* An introduction to the JavaFX Script language
* A tour of the core APIs including graphics, animations, and media
* How to access RESTFUL Web Services
* Developing and deploying to different target profiles (desktop, web, mobile)
* Java Runtime Environment 6 Update 10+:this new version of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) provides a redesigned Java browser plug-in that allows drag and drop of JavaFX applications from the browser to the desktop.
* Futures and roadmap for JavaFX
</code></pre><p><strong><em>Come expecting to see lots of code</em></strong> After attending this session, attendees will walk away with a good understanding of JavaFX language and how to develop special effects in GUI and 2D Graphics and add special features as audio, video and animation into their applications.</p>
