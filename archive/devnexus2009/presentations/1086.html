				<p>Dynamic languages running on the Java Virtual Machine are starting to gain traction for software development, specifically for large enterprise projects. This session explores obstacles to introducing dynamic languages into the enterprise, example applications that can ease the way, and issues surrounding integrating a dynamic language to Java projects. Using several code examples that demonstrate the power of using a dynamic language like Jruby or Groovy, attendees will gain insight into how dynamic languages are making in-roads to the enterprise. This session focuses on non-GUI related usages – whereas most people think of dynamic languages for Web development. The target audience for this session is enterprise developers and enterprise architects.</p>
<pre><code>* How to incrementally introduce dynamic languages into an existing project
* Real world examples of using dynamic languages for better testing and writing utilities
* Understanding how to integrate a dynamic language into a Java-based project
</code></pre>
