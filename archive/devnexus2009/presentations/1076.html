				<p>The demand continues to grow for rich interactive content, applications, and services that run on a variety of screens such as mobile, desktop, browser, and television. With the release of JavaFX SDK 1.1 it is possible to incorporate innovative elements of rich client applications into existing Java software with minimum effort enabling consistent user experiences across multiple screens such as desktop, browser and mobile devices. Sun is bringing its JavaFX development framework to mobile devices. JavaFX includes a scene graph library and a unique scripting language that provides a declarative syntax for constructing sophisticated graphical user interfaces. Its graphics capabilities include support for animation, visual effects, gradients, and translucency. The latest release of the JavaFX SDK, version 1.1, offers full support for mobile JavaFX development and includes an emulator for testing mobile device compatibility.</p><p>This keynote provides a glimpse into cross-screen applications development using JavaFX libraries such as animation and media applications with cross-platform audio and video. Additionally, this session will illuminate the JavaFX SDK 1.1 that provides a suite of tools for web scripters, designers and application developers.</p>
