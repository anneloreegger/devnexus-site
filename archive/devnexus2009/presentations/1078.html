				<p>In the past 8 years, the Java EE platform has grown and matured, and is now able to cover a wide range of enterprise and web application development needs. It has fostered a vibrant community and marketplace for additional technologies, frameworks, and applications that work with the platform. Java EE 6 carries on the push for ease of development started in Java EE 5, by extending it to include the web tier, for example by including the new API for RESTful web services, JAX-RS. The major themes for Java EE 6 are to offer more flexibility at development and deployment time, and to make it simpler to build on the many third-party libraries created by the community. To that end we propose several goals for this release - extensibility, pruning, profiles and ease of development.</p><p>In this talk we&rsquo;ll provide an introduction to the Java Platform Enterprise Edition (Java EE) 6. First we&rsquo;ll focus on the high-level ideas that drove this release of the platform. Then we&rsquo;ll move into the detailed contents, highlighting the most innovative concepts, starting with profiles and moving down into the many exciting new features of the component JSRs.</p>
