				<p>During this presentation, we&rsquo;ll walk through the highly automated process of creation of RIA using Eclipse plugins. The first plugin will generate a CRUD application having Adobe Flex talking to POJO on the server, which in turn communicates with a DBMS. Then, another plugin will generate an ANT build script for this application. The third plugin will add logging capabilities for Flex/Java rich Internet applications.</p>
