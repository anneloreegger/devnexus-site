				<p>Along with databases for structured content, content repositories emerged to tailor to content management needs. The content repository has rich metaphors for modeling content metadata, relationships between data, and behaviors that contents needs have. It also adds higher level concepts like workflow, security mechanisms, ability to automatically transform between formats, and many other features. In this talk we will examine the advantages of using a content management repository for storing content and how it enables rapid development of certain types of applications. This core technology can be exposed through SOAP or RESTful Services to play a role in your SOA strategy. With several open standards emerging in this area (newest one, CMIS has the promise of becoming the SQL for Content Repositories), the content repository paradigm has emerged as a standard part of any SOA strategy. Alfresco, an open source enterprise content repository framework, will be used as an example of this paradigm. What you will learn:</p>
<pre><code>* Take a look at Content Repository Abstraction
* Define Content-As-A-Service (CaaS) architecture
* Understand the reusable services that content repositories provide
* Look at emerging interoperability standards in this area
</code></pre>
