				<p>The Fabric8 project delivers PaaS infrastructure that runs on Kubernetes (provided by Red Hat OpenShift 3) and Docker container technology. It helps you to create, deploy and manage a Micro Service Architecture. To manage all these micro services Fabric8 ships with a fully integrated API Manager called &lsquo;Apiman&rsquo;. Apiman is a central management system that can manage all your APIs and publish them on one or more standalone gateways. Once a microservices endpoint is published to the gateway, requests are routed over the gateway where policies are applied on the way to and from of the service. We will demo these capabilities and show you how to configure and apply policies like Basic Authentication, Rate Limiting, IP White/Black Listing, etc as well as how to set up plans and contracts between service developers and service consumers.</p>
