				<p>When we talk about automation in software development, we immediately think of automated builds and deployments. We may also be using scripts to help make our daily work easier. But this is really just the beginning of the rise of the machines.<br/>I show you how leading developers in our industry are using open source and commercial tools for automating much more. They&rsquo;ve got &ldquo;robots&rdquo; for monitoring production servers, updating issues, supporting customers, reviewing code, setting up laptops, doing development reporting, conducting customer feedback &ndash; even automating daily standups. In what instances is it useful to automate? In what cases does it not make sense? Automation prevents us from having to do the same thing twice, helps us to work better together, reduces workflow errors and frees up time to write production code. Plus, as it turns out, spending time on automation is fun! Don&rsquo;t be afraid of robots in software development, embrace them! Even if I save you just half an hour a week, this talk will be a beneficial investment of your time.</p>
