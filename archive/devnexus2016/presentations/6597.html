				<p>This multi-disciplinary session takes a deep dive into<br/>the confluence of topics required to fully understand the intersection<br/>of Continuous Delivery and architecture, including evolutionary<br/>architecture and emergent design, with an emphasis on how<br/>architectural decisions affect the ease in changing and evolving your<br/>code, the role of metrics to understand code, how Domain Driven<br/>Design&rsquo;s Bounded Context reifies in architecture, how to reduce<br/>intra-component/service coupling, and other techniques.</p><p>Continuous Delivery is a process for automating the production<br/>readiness of your application every time a change occurs â€“ to code,<br/>infrastructure, or configuration. In the Continuous Delivery world,<br/>rather than hone skills at predicting the future via Big Design Up<br/>Front, Continuous Delivery emphasizes techniques for understanding<br/>and changing code with less cost during the process. Some architectures<br/>and engineering practices yield better designs for this<br/>environment.
