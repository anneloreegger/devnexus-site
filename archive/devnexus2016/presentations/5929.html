				<p>Organizations have moved from making their employees available to having their applications available directly to the users. This changes the magnitude of scale<br/>of interactions the applications have to support. Furthermore, with devices and bots accessing the systems, weâ€™re looking at a complete different rate of response than we once had to aim for.</p><p>In this presentation we will discuss the fundamentals of reactive systems, the key design goals, and the technologies that facilitate building such systems.</p>
