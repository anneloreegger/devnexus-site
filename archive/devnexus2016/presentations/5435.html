				<p>With a strong focus on annotations, minimalist configuration, simple deployment, intelligent defaults and Java centric type-safety, Java EE is one of the most productive full-stack development platforms around today. This very code centric workshop is a quick tour of the Java EE platform as it stands today. If you haven&rsquo;t seen Java EE for a while and want to catch up, this session is definitely for you. </p><p>We will start with the basic principals of what Java EE is and what it is not, overview the platform at a high level and then dive into each key API like JSF, CDI, EJB 3, JPA, JAX-RS, WebSocket and JMS using examples and demos. This is your chance to look at Java EE 7 in the context of a realistic application named Cargo Tracker, available with an MIT license at <a href="http://cargotracker.java.net/">http://cargotracker.java.net</a>. </p><p>We will also briefly take a look at the emerging horizons of Java EE 8.</p>
