				<p>JSR107, aka the Temporary Caching API for the Java Platform, has now been finalized almost 2 years ago. We&rsquo;ve heard all about its ease of use and capabilities. But there is much left unaddressed. The good news is that the EG is looking at addressing many of the current shortcomings&hellip; But what do you do now? Go for proprietary APIs?!<br/>Ehcache, the de facto caching API for 10 years now, has gone through a major API revamp: Ehcache3. One major theme, beyond its usual ease of use, was JSR107. Natively integrating it, but also looking beyond. With close to no API tie-ins, Ehcache3 lets you extend the JSR107 API transparently to go beyond the specification: topology-wise: whether you want to go offheap and scale up, or scale out by clustering your caches; functionality-wise: using transactional caches, automatic resource control or even using a write-behind cache to scale out writes&hellip;<br/>Best of all is that this isn&rsquo;t only minimally intrusive, it is also all free to use and available as part of the open-source Ehcache v3 that has been GA&rsquo;ed earlier this year&hellip; </p>
