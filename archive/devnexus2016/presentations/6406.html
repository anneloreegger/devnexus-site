				<p>This is my story of lessons learned on why improvement efforts fail&hellip; I had a great team. We were disciplined about best practices and spent tons of time on improvements. Then I watched my team slam into a brick wall. We brought down production three times in a row, then couldn&rsquo;t ship again for a year.</p><p>Despite our best efforts with CI, unit testing, design reviews, and code reviews, we lost our ability to understand the system. We thought our problems were caused by technical debt building up in the code base, but we were wrong. We failed to improve, because we didn&rsquo;t solve the right problems. Eventually, we turned our project around, but with a lot of tough lessons along the way.</p><p>To learn, we need a feedback loop. To improve, we need a feedback loop with a goal. There&rsquo;s five different ways our project feedback loop can break:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Broken Target</strong> - Our definition of &ldquo;better&rdquo; is broken.</li>
  <li><strong>Broken Visibility</strong> - We don&rsquo;t see the pain, so we take no action.</li>
  <li><strong>Broken Clarity</strong> - We don&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s causing the pain.</li>
  <li><strong>Broken Awareness</strong> - We don&rsquo;t know how to avoid the pain.</li>
  <li><strong>Broken Focus</strong> - We see the pain, but our attention is focused on something else.</li>
</ul><p>Find out how to repair the broken feedback loops on your software project by learning from my mistakes.</p>
