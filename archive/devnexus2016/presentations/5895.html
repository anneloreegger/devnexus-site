				<p>How to build web sites that work well across various browsers versions and devices is always challenging for web developers. In the session, you&rsquo;ll learn the best practices and strategy to develop cross-browser web sites that will work with the existing and future browsers. Tools for interoperability tests, cross-browser fundamentals, and tips and tricks on HTML5, CSS, JavaScript development will be illustrated. Feature detection, CSS prefix, and fallbacks will all be examined in the session. A real life example will be used to demonstrate step by step how to build cross-browser and plug-in-Free experiences. With a couple of simple changes to your sites, you can take advantage of web standards and HTML5 features today without breaking your sites in the future. Expect a lot of demos and code in the session.</p>
