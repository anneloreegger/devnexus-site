				<p>&quot;You might be able to read email on your watch, but mine can remotely control a drone!” Got your attention? Good! Whether you&rsquo;re working with drones or humidity sensors, accessing connected devices at a moments notice is a requirement of every Internet of Things solution. Taking advantage of wearables like an Apple Watch to provide that access is the ultimate convenience. In this session you will see how you can securely connect remote devices such as drones to the IBM IoT Foundation and capture real time information from them within an application deployed to Bluemix and a Apple Watch. This session will sure to be fun, but also be jammed packed live code samples and demonstrations!</p>
