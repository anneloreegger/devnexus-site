				<p>This presentation will provide a deep dive into new Apache project: Apache Ignite. Apache Ignite is the in-memory data fabric that combines in-memory cluster &amp; computing, in-memory data grid and in-memory streaming under one umbrella of a fabric. In-memory data fabric slides between applications and various data sources and provides ultimate performance and scalability to the applications. </p><p>Apache Ignite is the first general purpose in-memory computing platform in Apache Software Foundation family. We believe it will have same effect on Fast Data processing as Hadoop has on Big Data processing. Better understanding of inner details behind Apache Ignite will hopefully encourage more companies and individual committers to join the project.</p>
