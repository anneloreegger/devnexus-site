				<p>At Netflix, we provide a Java-based API that supports the content discovery, sign-up, and playback experience on thousands of device types that millions use around the world every day. As our user base and traffic have grown by leaps and bounds, we are continuously evolving this API to enable the best user experience. In this talk, I will give an overview of how and why the Netflix API has evolved to where it is today and where we plan to take it in the future. I will discuss how we make our system resilient against failures using tools such as Hystrix and FIT, while keeping it flexible and nimble enough to support continuous A/B testing.</p>
