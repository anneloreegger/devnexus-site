				<p>This presentation looks at the importance of events and the role that they play in software applications. We describe how events are a key application integration mechanism and how they are used by applications to communicate with the outside world. You will learn how the microservices inside a system can use events to maintain data consistency. We discuss how easy it is to implement both these mechanisms by developing your core business logic using an event-centric approach.</p>
