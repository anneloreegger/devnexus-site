				<p>Kotlin, a language developed by JetBrains for nearly 5 years is very close to its first release. However, did you know that it&rsquo;s being used in production for over a few years now already? Both inside and outside of JetBrains there are people deploying Kotlin applications for Android platform, for Web Applications and just about any other type of application. </p><p>Why are people using it instead of Java or some of the other languages out there? Primarily because it provides significant benefits in terms of conciseness, readability and safety, without some of the drawbacks that adopting a new language has such as a higher learning curve or interoperability with existing code and ecosystems. See Kotlin not only is interoperable with the Java 100% but even can target JavaScript and allow you to share client and server code while fitting nicely within the ecosystem. </p><p>Come and find out more about this language and what benefits it can provide you. </p>
