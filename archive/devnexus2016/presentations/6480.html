				<p>You&rsquo;re an architect or a developer with years of experience creating amazing applications. You&rsquo;ve just been assigned to a low latency project! Because you&rsquo;re an expert, you&rsquo;re expected to master a new In-Memory caching/data technology and be productive from Day 1. You feel completely lost as you open the JAR files. Not only that, but you have to contend with new topologies and data stores like NoSQL or Hadoop. Trust me, it&rsquo;s not as bad as it appears and setting up in-memory data is NOT as hard as you think. This session will cover the things you need to know to be successful on your first low latency in-memory based project.<br/>This presentation will be highly useful for developers and architects of the high performance applications. The attendees will learn about modern in-memory technology landscape, distributed data topologies that work well, how to make in-memory reliable, scalable and durable, the techniques for really Big In-Memory Data will be revealed! And most important, no prior knowledge of In-memory data grids required!</p>
