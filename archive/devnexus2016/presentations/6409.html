				<p>This is my story of lessons learned on how to stop the crushing effects of business pressure&hellip; I was team lead with full control of our green-field project. After a year, we had continuous delivery, a beautiful clean code base, and worked directly with our customers to design the features. Then our company split in two, we were moved under different management, and I watched my project get crushed. </p><p>As a consultant, I saw the same pattern of relentless business pressure everywhere, driving one project after another into the ground. I made it my mission to help the development teams solve this problem. This is my story of lessons learned on how to transform an organization from the bottom up. I&rsquo;ll show you how to lead the way.</p><p><strong>Warning:</strong> This strategy won&rsquo;t work in all organizations. In some cases, management doesn&rsquo;t want to know the truth. However, in most organizations I&rsquo;ve worked with, management wants to improve, but doesn&rsquo;t know how to fix the system. </p><p>The crushing business pressure is caused by a broken feedback loop that&rsquo;s baked into the organization&rsquo;s design. In this presentation, I&rsquo;ll show you how to fix the broken feedback loop. Learn how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gather evidence of developer productivity loss</li>
  <li>Identify the key organizational changes required for success</li>
  <li>Make the case to management for improvement</li>
  <li>Partner with your manager for long-term success</li>
</ul><p>If the system is broken, we need to fix the system. You can <em>change</em> the system by making the decision to lead.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>This talk is not strictly dependent on attending, &ldquo;Top 5 Reasons Why Improvement Efforts Fail&rdquo;, but you&rsquo;ll get way more out of the session, if you attend both.</em></p>
