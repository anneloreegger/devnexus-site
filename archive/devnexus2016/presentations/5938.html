				<p>Encryption is a powerful tool for privacy. At least that is what we&rsquo;re meant to think.</p><p>If you consider encryption to be a black box of magic, you should probably attend this talk.<br/>If you think encryption will protect your secrets, you should probably attend this talk.<br/>If you have (or haven&rsquo;t) been following the news, you should probably attend this talk.</p><p>The truth is, encryption can be an effective way of making it harder for people to steal your secrets. But it isn&rsquo;t magical, it isn&rsquo;t fool proof and, depending on how you are using it, may be completely useless. It is a hard topic that we&rsquo;ll only touch the surface on, but there are very few topics that are more crucial for our industry and profession to understand better than encryption. You don&rsquo;t have to understand the math (although that will help), but you do have to understand what it will and won&rsquo;t do for you*.</p><p>*and how implementations of it may have been intentionally compromised</p>
