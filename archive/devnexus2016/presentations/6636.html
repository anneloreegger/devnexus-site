				<p>More strange, more bizarre, more fun! The Groovy Puzzlers hits with its second season in which we implemented the lesson learned from the first one - do more of the same (always as a duet)! Expect even more “NO WAY!”, “WHOA!”, “WTF!”, O_o and prizes flying around, and expect to learn more about Groovy’s darkest secrets! As usual, the traps we fell into here in JFrog and contributions from top-notch Groovy authors and users!</p>
