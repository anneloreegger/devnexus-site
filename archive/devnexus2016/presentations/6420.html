				<p>It&rsquo;s March Madness! Be the office pool champion by using machine learning to predict your bracket for the NCAA tournament. Using a new Spring project, Spring Cloud Tasks, we will demonstrate how on demand processing can be used to handle various tasks including batch processing, ETL, data science tasks, and other non-descript functions that need to be executed on demand. A general understanding of the Spring Framework is assumed.</p>
