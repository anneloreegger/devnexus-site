				<p>Architecting and developing user interfaces used to be relatively easy, pick a server side framework, define a standard monitor resolution and spend your days dealing with browser quirks. But today, the landscape presents us with a plethora of screen sizes and resolutions covering everything from a phone to a tablet to a TV. How does a team embrace this brave new world knowing that the future will introduce even more volatility to the client space?</p><p>This talk will walk you through this brave new world. We&rsquo;ll discuss the deluge of devices the typical application must deal with today as well as looking at the plethora of client side rendering technologies. This isn&rsquo;t strictly a front end problem though, we need to reconsider how we&rsquo;ve built our server side solutions as well; modern applications rely on RESTful web services delivering data to a diverse set of clients. The development landscape has changed, this talk will prepare you to face these challenges.</p>
