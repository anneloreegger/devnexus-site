				<p>Since the inception of the JAR modularity has been a big reason why developers have chosen Java as a development platform. In Java&rsquo;s 20 year history there have never been so many options to choose from. This talk explores modularity from OSGi, to Docker, to the upcoming Java 9 release with the promise of Project Jigsaw. Attendees will leave this session with a better understanding of the different types of modular architectures available for Java applications and when to use each.</p>
