We have a series of tools and techniques for managing identity, authentication, authorization and encryption so we only share content with those we trust.</p><p>Before we tackle Web Security, however, we need to figure out what we mean by Security. We will pull from the worlds of Security Engineering and Software Security to lay the foundation for technical approaches to protecting our web resources.</p>
