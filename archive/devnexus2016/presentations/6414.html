				<p>The third platform, characterized by a fluid infrastructure where virtualized servers come into and out of existence, and workloads are constantly being moved about and scaled up and down to meet variable demand, calls for new design patterns, processes and even culture. One of the most well known descriptions of these new paradigms is the Twelve Factor App (12factor.net), which describes elements of cloud native applications. Many of these needs are squarely met through the Spring Framework, others require support from other systems. In this session we will examine each of the twelve factors and present how Spring, and platforms such as Cloud Foundry satisfy them, and in some cases we’ll even suggest that responsibility should shift from Spring to platforms. At the conclusion you will understand what is needed for cloud‐native applications, why and how to deliver on those requirements.</p>
