				<p>There are more than 50 actively worked JVM languages in existence today. Some have been ported to the JVM, whereas others were written specifically for the JVM. This hands-on session takes an introductory (but non-Hello, World) look at several JVM languages, including Java 8, Scala, Groovy, Kotlin, Ceylon and Xtend. It covers ZeroTurnaround’s initial experiences, including what rocked and sucked in learning each one. You don’t need any prior knowledge of these languages to attend the session. You will learn whether they are for you and will hear about some real-life experiences of trying these languages for the first time.</p>
