				<p>It&rsquo;s often hard to figure out the best Git workflow for a given team. The one size fits all advice you often find online is wrong, but few people have hands on experience with enough different workflows to provide balanced advice. Over the last few years I&rsquo;ve worked with hundreds of companies to figure out the right workflows for their needs.</p><p>In this session we&rsquo;ll start from a simple, clean &ldquo;GitHub Flow&rdquo; workflow, showing how, where and when you might need to add release tags, release branches, integration branches and/or fork based workflows. We&rsquo;ll also look at best practices for cleaning up history (when it makes sense to rebase or rebase -i) and pragmatic approaches to decomposing Git repos using subtrees and submodules.</p>
