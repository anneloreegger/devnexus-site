				<p>This course will introduce you to the various skills that go into data science, provide practical walkthroughs of relevant languages and tools and lay down a study plan for moving forward in this field.</p><p>As there is a rush to hire data scientists these days, there is a coincident rush to update resumes to include the term &ldquo;Data Scientist&rdquo;. Unfortunately, like most types of science, it is less a single topic and more a multi-disciplinary way of thinking, inquiring and communicating.</p><p>You won&rsquo;t become a data scientist over night, but you can learn to be one in time. Individuals do not need to know everything about the field, but teams should be composed of individuals who collectively do.</p><p>We will cover:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data Science as a field</li>
  <li>Basic statistics and numerical methods for dealing with data</li>
  <li>Doing Data Analysis in Spreadsheets</li>
  <li>The R programming language, its environment and online ecosystem</li>
  <li>R&rsquo;s visualization packages</li>
  <li>Interacting and visualizing data with D3.js</li>
  <li>Interacting with Big Data environments in R</li>
  <li>Interacting with Linked Data in R</li>
</ul>
