				<p>2020 is just a few years away. Where are we headed in that short time? Let&rsquo;s first look back on past to understand where we have been in order for us to know where we are going. We will also look what we should be doing right now. In addition, let&rsquo;s talk a lot about what is ahead and what actions we should do now to get ready for it. Micro Services, cross platform discussion, mobile devices, omnichannel strategy, scalable architecture, corny movie quotes and dance moves - all in one presentation!</p>
