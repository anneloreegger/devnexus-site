				<p>In this training, you will discover a consistent and reinforcing set of tools and practices rooted in the philosophy of small and simple; this can help you move towards a microservice architecture. Microservices are typically small systems, with single responsibilities, communicating via the networks, installed as well-behaved operating system services. However, with these finer-grained systems come new sources of complexity.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong></p><p>Developers, architects, technical leaders, operations engineers and anybody interested in the design and architecture of services and components.</p><p><strong>What You Will Learn</strong></p><p>During this training, you will understand in depth what the benefits are of microservice architectures, how to break apart your existing monolithic applications, and the practical concerns of managing these systems. We will discuss how to ensure your systems can be more stable, how to handle security and the additional complexity of monitoring and deployment.</p>
