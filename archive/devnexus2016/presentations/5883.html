				<p>Microservice architectures are quite popular, described as &ldquo;SOA done correctly&rdquo;. But what are the real differences between Service <em>Oriented</em>, Service <em>Based</em>, and *Micro*service architectural styles? And what about middle ground between the <em>shared everything</em> of SOA versus <em>shared nothing</em> of microservices? This talk explores the similarities and differences between various service-oriented architectural styles. I describe the characteristics of SOA, microservices, and hybrid service-based architectures, along with decision criteria to choose between them. I also discuss specific engineering practices, orchestration styles, reuse strategies, and migrating between architectural styles (e.g., from monolithic applications to service-based or microservice). No one architecture can solve every problem, and many projects take on more complexity than necessary by choosing the wrong paradigm. This talk equips attendees with the knowledge and context to choose the architecture that best fits their needs.</p>
