				<p>Join Jared Richardson to learn about GROWS, a modern development approach created by Agile manifesto author Andy Hunt and Jared Richardson. GROWS is built around the Dreyfus Model of Skills Acquisition and deliberate experimentation to guide project decisions. Incorporating existing practices, it&rsquo;s a methodology designed to improve both initial adoption and on-going evolution of your team and organization. Jared describe GROWS in detail, diving into specific steps and practices for managers and executives. Learn techniques to share the company&rsquo;s vision effectively, and simple tools for managing progress without micromanaging. Know when a project is doing well and when it&rsquo;s in trouble. Discover how to keep your team on track with the R&rsquo;s: building on a Rhythm (their iteration cadence), building the Right thing (from the vision), and working the Right way (with craftsmanship and technical practices). Come, learn, and participate as Jared provides an understanding of the GROWS Method and how it can move your company forward.</p>
