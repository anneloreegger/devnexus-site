			<div class="biography-body">
				<p>This presentation covers benefits and drawbacks of various popular Java EE microservices security approaches (Diffie-Hellman, RSA, HMAC) and looks at how to implement them in real-world examples. It explains why hash-based message authentication is best for microservice communication and has remained uncrackable. The presentation also shows that HMAC is fast, efficient, stateless, scalable, and DOS-resistant and can securely use any protocol and framework that supports messaging with headers, with no risk to the transport layer.</p>
