				<p>Join this session to learn how to create a Java-based microservice using Spring Boot, containerize it using Maven plugins, and subsequently deploy a fleet of microservices and dependent components such as Redis using Kubernetes.</p><p>Spring Boot makes creating microservices fast and easy when it comes to running a single instance. Like most Java applications, the harder part is usually the clustering and fail-over configurations.</p><p>First, we&rsquo;ll go over how to get started with Spring Boot, and, subsequently, using Maven plugins to generate and create Docker images during the build process.</p><p>Next, we&rsquo;ll go over some basic architecture and configurations, such as:<br/>- Configuring Spring Session<br/>- Using Redis as the session store<br/>- Testing the configuration locally with container linking<br/>- Tips and tricks for faster startup (/dev/./urandom is your friend)</p><p>Finally, with the images, we&rsquo;ll deploy the microservice into Kubernetes:<br/>- Defining pods and services<br/>- Linking microservices to Redis using Kubernetes<br/>- Perform rolling upgrades of the application<br/>- Canary new versions of the microservices into the fleet</p><p>The best part is we can visualize all these activities happening in Kubernetes.</p>
