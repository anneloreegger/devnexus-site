				<p>With the ascent of DevOps, microservices, containers, and cloud-based development platforms, the gap between state-of-the-art solutions and the technology that enterprises typically support has greatly increased. But some enterprises are now looking to bridge that gap by building microservice-based architectures on top of Java EE. Can it be done? Is it even a good idea? We thoroughly explores the possibility and provides savvy advice for enterprises that want to move ahead. The issue is complex: Java EE wasn’t built with the distributed application approach in mind, but rather as one monolithic server runtime or cluster hosting many different applications. If you’re part of an enterprise development team investigating the use of microservices with Java EE, there are several items to consider.</p>

					<p>Markus Eisele is a Java Champion, former Java EE Expert Group member, Java community leader of German DOAG, founder of JavaLand, reputed speaker at Java conferences around the world, and a very well known figure in the Enterprise Java world. He works for Lightbend.<br/>You’ve known and seen him at different conferences and Java User Groups meetups or read his blogs or are following his social media presence. While talking about middleware for many years you’ll continue to hear him talk about enterprise grade Java going forward. Focussed on education about the latest trends in building enterprise systems in a reactive way with Java.<br/>He’s been looking into containers and microservices architectures more deeply and also wrote a book about modern Java EE Design Patterns with O’Reily. He is excited to educate more about how microservices architectures can integrate and complement existing platforms, and will also talk about how to successfully build resilient applications with Java.</p>
