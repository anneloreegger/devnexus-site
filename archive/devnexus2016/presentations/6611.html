				<p>It&rsquo;s 2015. Are you still writing data queries by hand? Learn how Spring Data gives you the tools to leap over that hurdle and dive into solving problems. Feeling locked into your relational database due to having written gobs of SQL operations? See how Spring Data provides the means to reduce that risk and give you the means to branch into other data stores. In this talk, you&rsquo;ll see how to rapidly get off the ground with data persistence, how Spring Data supports lots of platforms, and also how you can take your solution and turn it into a REST service with just a few extra lines.</p>
