				<p>UI Development is a great confluence of Computer Science and Art. At the core, it is a matter of applying sound Software Engineering principles. However, in the daze of current UI trends, frameworks and libraries, we sometimes get distracted from the core principles. </p><p>This talk is about re-orienting ourselves with the core ideas and practices that surround effective UI Development. Not surprisingly, many of these ideas have been embraced by current frameworks and libraries. We will take a step back, peel some of the layers and look at the building blocks of effective UI Engineering. Few things we will touch upon include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Decomposing a Wireframe</li>
  <li>Thinking in layers</li>
  <li>Component-Oriented development</li>
  <li>Optimizing the Single Threaded UI</li>
</ul>
