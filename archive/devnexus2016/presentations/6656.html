				<p>You went ahead a built a whole new set of shiny microservices. While doing this you realize you can no longer rely on you Application Server to handle all the authentication. Oh, and of course one of your teams used Node.JS How are you going to secure all these endpoints so that the end user doesn&rsquo;t have to authenticate against each one. This talk will be a demonstration of using a centralized authentication service to secure many different microservice architecture. The demos will Project Keycloak but would apply just as well with Stormpath, Ping.Indenty, or similar services.</p>
