				<p>Any of these happen to you?</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Tasked to develop a user interface with an incomplete design spec, so had to make guesses such as where to position on-screen elements?</p></li>
  <li><p>Worked on a small team without a full-time designer, and requested to &ldquo;just put a screen together for a demo&rdquo;?</p></li>
  <li><p>Been asked to consult with a user interface designer, but don&rsquo;t know what types of questions to pose?</p></li>
</ul><p>Nowadays, everyone wants attractive, easy-to-use interfaces, so if you&rsquo;re more comfortable sifting through Java or C# code than OmniGraffle or Visio mockups, learn about topics that can assist in creating more usable desktop applications, mobile apps, and websites. This talk provides easy-to-implement hints that can improve even a bad or &ldquo;so-so&rdquo; user interface. Areas of focus include the need for consistency; &ldquo;negative space&rdquo;; location, location, location (it&rsquo;s crucial in screen real-estate, too!); contrasting colors; and the importance of action verbs. </p>
