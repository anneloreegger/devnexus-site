				<p>For many years, software architecture was described as the &ldquo;parts that are hard to change later&rdquo;. But software architecture is the balancing of capabilities versus constraints. If build <em>changeability</em> one of your prime capabilites, evolutionary change becomes easier. The microservice architectural style is quite popular, but it is only one in a family of <em>evolutionary</em> architectures. This session defines the characteristics this family of architectural styles, along with engineering and DevOps practices necessary for implementation. I cover the principles behind evolutionary architectures, the practices needed for success, how organization and team structure affects these architectures, and specific engineer practices that facilitate evolutionary architectures. I also discuss migration strategies from common existing architectural types towards move evolutionary architectures.</p>
