				<p>Despite the range of options across HTML, CSS, and any number of JavaScript frameworks, many design and development teams are struggling to implement style guides and leverage reusable UI component libraries. While many web template frameworks have UI components, there hasn&rsquo;t been a stable, long-term standard until now with W3C Web Components. Atlassian already uses the open-source skate.js framework to implement the Atlassian Design Guidelines (ADG) as Web Components in the Atlassian User Interface (AUI) framework. That means the future of Web Components is now: thousands of users are seeing the result in production across the family of Atlassian products.</p>
