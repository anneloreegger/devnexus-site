				<p>Microservices are currently at the center of the hype cycle in software architecture. Much of the discussion is very technology/programming-centric or bikeshedding on &ldquo;how big a service should be.&rdquo; Unfortunately, what&rsquo;s often missed is how the ideas and principles found in DevOps, Continuous Delivery, Domain-Driven Design, and Agile have converged into an architectural style that supports the operationalization of those same ideas and principles, and that architecture has is what we now call &ldquo;Cloud Native.&rdquo; In this workshop we&rsquo;ll cut through the hype and look at how we can start delivering great software.</p><p>We will cover the following big ideas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Microservices Defined: Domain-Driven Design at Scale</li>
  <li>The convergence of Microservices with Continuous Delivery</li>
  <li>Inverting Conway&rsquo;s Law: Defining Team Structure via Context Mapping</li>
  <li>Cloud Foundry: Self-service Agile Infrastructure for Business Capability Teams</li>
  <li>Spring Boot/Data/Cloud: Frameworks for Assembling Pattern-Based Distributed Systems</li>
  <li>Consumer-Driven Contracts for Scalable Dependency Testing</li>
  <li>Continuous Delivery Pipelines for Microservices</li>
</ul><p>You will need to bring a laptop for this workshop! For the greatest success, try to have the following prerequisites installed before you arrive:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">Java 8 JDK</a> (not just JRE)</li>
  <li><a href="https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi">Apache Maven</a> (latest)</li>
  <li><a href="http://curl.haxx.se/download.html">cURL</a> (latest)</li>
  <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a> (latest)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html">RabbitMQ</a> (latest)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases">Cloud Foundry Client</a> (latest)</li>
  <li><a href="https://spring.io/tools">Spring Tool Suite</a> (latest)</li>
</ul><p>In addition, we will have a few optional advanced labs that may require booting a VM on your laptop. To expedite that process, please add the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html">Vagrant</a> (latest)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a> (latest)</li>
