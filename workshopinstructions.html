         <p>In order to maximize your learning time,  do your setup before you
         arrive on Wednesday.  The conference pays for wi-fi,  however it is
         a public network and not intended to to download all of maven,
         github, and npm!</p>

         <p>Also, we do not guarantee assistance with specific install / setup
         issues on the day of the workshop, the speaker will progress as fast
         as the majority of the class allows and you will be left behind.</p>

         <p>If you do encounter specific problems with any of these instructions...
         Reach out to ...  and if it cannot be resolved with help before hand
         we find someone to help day of.</p>
