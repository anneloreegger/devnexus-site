				</p>
				<h2>Do we cover travel expenses?</h2>
				<p>
					We make that determination on a case-by-case basis. For speakers
					that are not affiliated with large organizations, we often do.
					However, if you represent a larger organization we typically don't.
					The reason is that we need to carefully watch our budget as we
					operate as non-profit and keep the ticket prices as low as possible.
					As we grow, we started to loosen the restrictions a bit but
					we rather still do the determination on a case by case basis.
