bio: "I'm an information technology professional with 20+ years of experience in software
  development. I have worked as a developer, consultant, architect, and software development
  manager with major clients in the private and federal public sectors. \r\n\r\nCurrently,
  I'm an open source developer advocate. In this role, I help the marketing team with
  technical overview and support to create, edit and curate product content. The content
  is shared with the communities through webinars, conferences, and other activities.
  I also develop workshops and support material to help the internal and partner enablement.\r\n\r\nSoftware
  development is my passion and I have been able to make it my life. As a passionate
  traveler, history, and food enthusiast, when I'm not at work I love to grab my suitcase
  and travel around the world in search of the tastiest food.\r\n\r\nI have a bachelor's
  degree in engineering from Tec de Monterrey Campus Monterrey and I'm always happy
  to contact old friends and coworkers, so contact me to get in touch.\r\n\r\nFor
  the past 20 years, Red Hatâ€™s development model has produced high-performing, cost-effective
  solutions. Today, more than 90% of Fortune 500 companies rely on Red Hat. We offer
  the only fully open technology stack, from operating system to middleware, storage
  to cloud, and virtualization solutions. We also provide a variety of services, including
  award-winning support, consulting, and training."
