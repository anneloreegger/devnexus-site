Gene Gotimer is a Principal Consultant at Coveros, Inc., a software company that uses agile methods to help customers build software better, faster, and more securely. They do this by focusing on agile development and DevOps practices such as continuous integration, repeatable builds, unit testing, automated functional testing, analysis tools, security scanning, and automated deploys. Gene feels strongly that repeatability, quality, and security are all strongly intertwined; each of them is dependent on the other two, which makes agile and DevOps that much more crucial to software development.
