Scott McAllister has been building web applications in several industries for over a decade. He joined Smartsheet several years ago, building integrations with the Smartsheet API using languages like Java, Node.js, and Python. Now he's helping others learn about a wide range of web technologies. When he's not coding, writing or speaking he enjoys long walks with his wife, skipping rocks with his kids, and is happy whenever Real Salt Lake can manage a win.
