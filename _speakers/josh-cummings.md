fullName: Josh Cummings
bio: Josh loves to code, and his kids love to code, too! Since he was a wee teenager
  with a TRS-80 from Radio Shack, he's loved building whatever came to mind. These
  days, he contributes full-time to Spring Security codebase. He also is the author
  of a handful of Java web security courses and loves learning from and mentoring
  others about application security. When Josh isn't coding, he's dunking over his
  kids on a seven-foot basketball hoop, eating frosted mini-wheats, or reading Brandon
  Sanderson. Or he's coding.
