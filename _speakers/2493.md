I am a Principal Consultant for Daugherty Business Solutions in Atlanta, where I lead our Software Architecture & Engineering practice I've been practicing software development for 35 years, 10 at IBM and the rest in consulting. My experience has been focused on architecting and building complex, mission critical software for Fortune 500 clients. When I'm not working, I like to go for long walks in the north Georgia mountains with my wife April and our one-year-old Great Dane, Molly.
