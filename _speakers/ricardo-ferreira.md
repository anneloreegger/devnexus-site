bio: "Ricardo is Senior Developer Advocate at AWS, working in the developer relations
  team for North America. With +20 years of experience, he may have learned a thing
  or two about distributed systems, fast data analytics, software architecture, databases,
  and observability. Before AWS, he worked for software vendors like Elastic, Confluent,
  and Oracle. Ricardo is well known for his remarkable ability to explain complex
  topics. He cunningly breaks them down into bite-sized pieces until anyone can understand.\r\n\r\nWhile
  not working, he loves barbecuing in his backyard with his family and friends, where
  he finally gets the chance to talk about anything unrelated to computers. He currently
  lives in North Carolina, USA, with his wife and son. Follow Ricardo on Twitter:
