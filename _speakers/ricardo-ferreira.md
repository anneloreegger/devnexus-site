fullName: Ricardo Ferreira
bio: "Ricardo works for AWS in the developer relations team. The world of developer
  relations is his current passion. After doing it as a hobby for +10 years, it became
  his full-time job after joining open source-based startups like Confluent and Elastic.
  Having experienced implementing developer relations programs from the ground up
  in these companies granted him an acute sense of what successful strategies are
  worth pursuing, and the ones to avoid.\r\n\r\nWith +20 years of experience, he built
  an extensive background in distributed systems, messaging, databases, and observability.
  The first 10 years of his career were spent in software engineering, where his primary
  focus was about programming languages, compilers, debuggers, code efficiency, and
  development best practices. Then, he spent another 10 years working as a solution
  architect in companies like Red Hat and Oracle."
