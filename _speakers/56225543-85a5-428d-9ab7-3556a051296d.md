lastName: Laborde
fullName: Gant Laborde
bio: "Gant Laborde is a New Orleans native, born and raised.  He grew up with hurricanes
  (not the drink), rich New Orleans culture, and as a free tour guide for all his
  out-of-state friends.  Over the years he’s seen his city experience corruption,
  flooding,  heartbreak, and most importantly, revived-determination.  “New Orleans
  doesn’t know how to quit,” Gant says, “that’s why I love it.” Gant firmly believes
  conflict abets passion, a fire always moves fastest uphill.\r\n \r\n\r\nAs CIO for
  the popular company Infinite Red, Gant works remotely from his home and uses his
  self-managed autonomy to explore a variety of leadership arts.  Besides managing
  the all-remote team from around the world, Gant has become a published author, adjunct
  professor, volunteer mentor, and a speaker at conferences worldwide.\r\n \r\n\r\nEach
  day, Gant refines what motivation and leadership mean as he strives to bridge the
  gap the theory and the concrete.  He voraciously consumes self-help books and online
  lectures, which he incorporates into his everyday processes.  Focus on personal
  enthusiasm and motivation to lead projects, workshops, and teams are the bedrock
  of success.  He refines these skills as often as possible at his local Toastmasters
  clubs, where he serves as Division Director."
