I'm a Developer Advocate for Oracle focusing on the Oracle Cloud. I have 15 years experience as a full stack developer.  I've been working with dynamic JVM languages and various JavaScript frameworks for my whole career - originally with ColdFusion and more recently Groovy/Grails on the server side.  I have experience with everything from jQuery, ExtJS to all versions of Angular on the front end.
