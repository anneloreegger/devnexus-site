I'm a full stack developer who has been working with dynamic JVM languages and various JavaScript frameworks since 2004.  I started working with ColdFusion and graduated in 2011 to Groovy with Grails on the server side and has experience with everything from ExtJS to Knockout to AngularJS on the front end.
