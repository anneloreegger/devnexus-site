I am a software consultant based in London, UK, currently working for 8th Light. I’m a member of the software craft community, and a founder and organizer of Queer Code London. As well as writing software, I enjoy mentoring others and promoting diversity & inclusion within the tech industry. I’m an occasional blogger and public speaker.
