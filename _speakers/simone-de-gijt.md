fullName: Simone de Gijt
bio: "Simone is a 30 year old scuba dive fanatic, who loves to dance, sing and go
  on adventures. She lives in Amsterdam and is currently working for OpenValue Amsterdam,
  for who she's a Java and Kotlin software developer consultant. \r\n \r\nIn her own
  time she volunteers as an educator on high schools about gender diversity and sexuality.
  Her passion, next to programming, is to make the world a little kinder.\r\n \r\nShe
  loves to be in a group, mingle, collaborate, talk and explain. But she wouldnâ€™t
  want to work without the excitement and satisfaction she feels when developing a
  new feature. She's defined by the combination: social but nerdy!"
