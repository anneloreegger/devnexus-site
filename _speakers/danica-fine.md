bio: "Danica began her career as a software engineer in data visualization and warehousing
  with a business intelligence team where she served as a point-person for standards
  and best practices in data visualization across her company. In 2018, Danica moved
  to San Francisco and pivoted to backend engineering with a derivatives data team
  which was responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure that processes
  millions of financial market data per second in near real-time. Her first project
  on this team involved Kafka Streams â€“ she never looked back. Danica now works as
  a Developer Advocate with Confluent where she helps others get the most out of their
  event-driven pipelines. \r\n\r\nOutside of work, Danica is passionate about sustainability,
  increasing diversity in the technical community, and keeping her many houseplants
  alive. She can be found on Twitter, tweeting about tech, plants, and baking @TheDanicaFine."
