bio: I’m a developer who advocates and evangelizes about interactive video streaming
  at Twitch. I’ve been writing code since 2004, and feel extremely lucky to be paid
  to do what I love and am truly passionate about. As part of my role as a Developer
  Advocate, I write lots of demos to show other developers how to use certain languages,
  frameworks, and technologies to solve the problems that they face every day. I have
  a background in writing and a love for theater, so I’m extra fortunate to have found
  a role that lets me use those skills and passions as part of my everyday routine.
  I’m married to my best friend and we live in the North Georgia mountains with our
  2 kids, 8 chickens, 2 dogs, a cat, and a potbelly pig named Milton. When I’m not
  working, I love to cook, play video games and tinker with electronics and microcontrollers.
