Andrew is a Sr. UI developer and designer with two decades of development experience in languages such as JavaScript, Visual Basic, Python, and C, and will admit to having developed a content management solution with Delphi and Perl if backed into a corner. When not arguing about the benefits of whitespace in UI design or how one must just pick a side in the great tabs versus spaces debate and be done with it, you can find Andrew at concerts, dabbling at photography, or discussing the merits of baseball teams holding on to an extra star relief pitcher.
