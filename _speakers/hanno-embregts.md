bio: "Hanno Embregts is a Java Developer with a passion for learning, teaching and
  making music.\r\n\r\nIn his day-to-day job as an IT Consultant at Info Support,
  Hanno prefers work that is fast-paced and versatile. This is why he juggles Java
  development, software architecture, public speaking, leading Info Support’s Java
  Community and teaching courses at Info Support’s Knowledge Centre. \r\n\r\nHanno
  is both a Java Champion and an Oracle ACE Associate. He is also one of the editors
  of the Dutch Java Magazine. Outside of work Hanno likes making music with his friends.
  He plays the flute, the guitar and he likes to sing.\r\n\r\nSoftware conferences
  are Hanno’s favourite thing in the world, because they allow him to do the three
  things he loves most at the same time: learning new things, teaching others about
  stuff he discovered and yes: even making music from time to time!\r\n"
tagLine: Java Developer by day, musician by night. A bit of both at conferences.
