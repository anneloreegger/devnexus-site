I am a <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/anthonydahanne">software developer with 15 years of experience</a>, and currently I'm working on management and monitoring components as well as "cloud migrations" for my employer, Software AG, making sure our products (mainly Java based applications) run well in the cloud, and in particular on Kubernetes.
