bio: I am a W3C Invited Expert and Accessibility Advocate as an independent consultant
  since 1999. I have been a Senior Accessibility Engineer for the past 25 years with
  extensive front and back end development experience having designed, built, and
  maintained websites for small and large companies, remediating and auditing websites
  for WCAG compliance and part of many at the W3C whom are working on WCAG3. I co-host
  a podcast, the Front End Nerdery Podcast, and stream on Twitch. Originally from
  Portland, Maine, and now living in Phoenix, Arizona, I love food and cooking, especially
  lobster and lobster rolls. In some circles, I am the Lobster guy on Twitter, I wear
  the moniker with pride.
