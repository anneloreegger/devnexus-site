Tobias Dunn-Krahn, Chief Technology Officer, xMatters

Tobias has more than 20 years of technology leadership experience, including 15 with xMatters.

To meet their expectations, digital service providers must anticipate and avoid issues, and to otherwise quickly resolve them, so they can focus on innovation.
