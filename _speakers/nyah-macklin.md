bio: 'Nyah Macklin is a Developer Evangelist at Couchbase. Nyah has a non-traditional
  background, with a degree in African & Afro-American Studies and a career in civil
  service and community organizing. This background gave them the expertise to decipher
  the ways systems within tech perpetuate the exclusion of historically underrepresented
