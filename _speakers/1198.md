Web Developer. Professor. Writer. Hogwarts Student. Doctor Who Companion. Okay, so maybe I am not a student at Hogwarts… I am sure I'd be sorted into Ravenclaw! And, maybe I am not a Doctor Who companion… But wouldn’t time traveling in the TARDIS be amazing? I am a former college professor turned web developer with the goal of making teaching and learning code more accessible.
