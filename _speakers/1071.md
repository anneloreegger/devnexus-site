I am a Java, Agile, and Clean Code advocate that is not afraid of databases, RESTful web services, or warm, gooey cookies.  I enjoy working with and leading Agile teams to deliver reliable, useful services and applications.  My current interests include Domain Driven Design, distributed databases, evolutionary architecture, and micro-services.
