bio: Amy Russ is currently the Vice President of Customer Analytics at Synchrony.
  She has over 11 years of experience as a data professional, having had the pleasure
  of seeing data move from being cool in Microsoft Access to the current 4th Industrial
  Revolution. Additionally, she also excels at being able to explain complex topics
  to individuals at all levels. Outside of data, Amy enjoys using her hands to create.
  She is currently exploring pottery (both hand-building and using the wheel) and
  baking (similar to low-code data analytics/science, minimal ingredient baking recipes
  are one of her current obsessions).
