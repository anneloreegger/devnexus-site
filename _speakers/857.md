Matthew is a (somewhat) functional programmer who enjoys all kinds of language nerdery as well as whisky.

He currently works on open-source code at Oracle, helping to make Java in the cloud be as good as it can.  If not there, you might find him at a local meetup, teaching kids to code, or away from computers hiking and running in Southwest England.

Past lives include OpenStacking, teaching English to highschoolers and a whole lot of Clojure and Java.
