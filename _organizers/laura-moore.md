Designer, Coder, Tester, Maintainer and Troubleshooter for the modern, integrated enterprise application ecosystem since 2000.

Laura loves nothing more than exploring ideas great and small, whether thatâ€™s the latest product feature or marketing plan, the latest trending topic on the blog-o-sphere, or the implications of a technology choice in my current application and society at large.

She currently works for UTC-CCS in what she likes to call "big-iron" IoT; delivering integrated smart building systems using Java and Web based tools to talk with and manage embedded devices.
