Ari Waller serves full-time on the Developer Relations Team as the Meetup Event Manager for JFrog.

Ari has utilized this knowledge and expertise in multiple leadership capacities while always remaining hands-on, as his passion is learning and engaging with the Technology Community Globally. Over the past few years, Ari sought to transform his platform to be authentically transparent and become an “open source” confidant for those who wanted IT career guidance. He brings his expertise and job market insight to technical professionals at meetups, boot camps, conferences, and panels in this effort.

With the rest of his spare, he enjoys spending time with his wife and his many children; as well as building Star Wars Legos and watching the Atlanta Hawks. Ari graduated from Temple University in Philadelphia with a degree in Education.
