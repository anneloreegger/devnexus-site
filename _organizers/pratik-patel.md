I have extensive experience leading teams, building products, building software, and building startup companies. I have worked as a developer, lead architect, and CTO in my career. I've published several books on Java technology & software development. I am also a Java Champion: a select group of Java technologists recognized for their technical and community contributions to the Java ecosystem.

I'm also a speaker at technology conferences delivering the knowledge I've learned over the years to tomorrow's technologists; having presented on Java, Web, and other technologies at over 200 conferences over the past 12 years. I'm currently working on a new book in the Java space, as well as live training with O'Reilly. I also have extensive experience with Web and Cloud technologies, and have built production apps on ML (Python), Rails, mobile.

On top of this, I am a heavily in the Java and general tech community. I'm organizing the Java User Groups (JUG) Leader Summit in 2020 as part of my work with the Atlanta JUG (a non-profit), where I am the current president. I am the conference chairperson for Devnexus, the largest Java conference in North America, run by AJUG. I also run two other meetups in my local Atlanta community: North Atlanta JavaScript & Web Dev, and Tech On the Beltline. As part of my big involvement in the Java community, I am well known in the Java space as a recognized leader.
